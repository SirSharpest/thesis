  abstract = {Research on academic writing has long stressed the connection between writing and the creation of an author's identity (Ivani{\v c}, 1998; Hyland, 2010). Identity is said to be created from the texts we engage in and the linguistic choices we make, thus relocating it from hidden processes of cognition to its social construction in discourse. Issues of agency and conformity, stability and change, remain controversial, however. Some writers question whether there is an unchanging self lurking behind such discourse and suggest that identity is a ``performance'' (see for instance Butler, 1990) while others see identity as the product of dominant discourses tied to institutional practices (Foucault, 1972). All this has been of particular interest to teachers and researchers of EAP because students and academics alike often feel uncomfortably positioned, even alienated, by the conventions of academic discourse. They sometimes complain that the voice they are forced to use requires them to ``talk like a book'' by adopting a formal and coldly analytical persona.\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}r\textbackslash{}nIn this paper I want to explore how we construct an identity in three rather neglected academic genres where the requirements of anonymity and impersonality are more relaxed. In thesis acknowledgements, doctoral prize applications and bio statements, writers are exempted from formal conventions of disciplinary argument and have an opportunity to reveal something of how they want to be seen by others. My question is: What use do they make of with these opportunities?},

  abstract = {Auxin has critical roles in plant growth, dependent upon its heterogeneous distribution in tissues. Exactly how auxin signalling and transport, and developmental processes such as growth coordinate to achieve the precise patterns of auxin observed experimentally is not well understood. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine the interplay between these effects and their contribution to formation of patterns in auxin distribution in plant tissues. Mathematical models describing auxin-related signalling pathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant tissues were derived. Models were analysed and solved numerically to examine the long-time behaviour and auxin distribution. Changes in auxin-related signalling processes were shown to be able to trigger transition between passage and spot type patterns in auxin distribution. The model was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory auxin levels which have been observed experimentally. Cell growth was shown to have strong influence on PIN polarisation and determination of auxin distribution patterns. Numerical simulation results indicate that auxin-related signalling processes can explain the different auxin distributions observed in plant tissues, whereas interplay between auxin transport and growth can explain the `reverse-fountain' pattern in auxin distribution observed at root tips.},

Simple diffusion equations are used to illustrate how resistance and respiration interact to create oxygen gradients and experimental and modelling examples of gradients in roots and the limitations of diffusive transport are presented and discussed. Attention is drawn to the limiting effects of diffusion especially in non-wetland species such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, a paucity of root gas-space and a cortical cell configuration found also in crop species, such as pea, tomato and cotton, is particularly unsuited for long-distance oxygen transport. The contrast with other more flood-tolerant Brassicas is highlighted. The relative roles of root aerenchymas and barrier formation to radial oxygen loss in improving oxygen supply and supporting root extension and phytotoxin exclusion in flooded soils are considered. Methods for monitoring radial oxygen loss from roots and oxygen concentrations both within and external to the plant are discussed, as are the results of analogue and more complex mathematical models that predict and explain the role of both diffusive and convective transport in plant aeration. Finally, pressurized gas-flow mechanisms and their ability to overcome diffusion limitations are briefly described and discussed.},

  abstract = {Modulated fringe pattern photobleaching (MFPP) was used to measure the translational diffusion of microinjected fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled proteins of different sizes in the cytoplasm of cultured muscle cells. This technique, which is an extension of the classical fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique, allows the measurement of the translational diffusion of macromolecules over several microns. Proteins used had molecular masses between 21 and 540 kDa. The results clearly indicated that the diffusivity of the various proteins is a decreasing function of their hydrodynamic radius. This decrease is more rapid with globular proteins than with FITC-labeled dextrans (, Biophys. J. 70:2327-2332), most likely because, unlike globular proteins, dextrans are randomly coiled macromolecules with a flexible structure. These data do not exclude the possibility of a rapid diffusion over a short distance, unobservable with our experimental set-up, which would take place within the first milliseconds after bleaching and would correspond to the diffusion in restricted domains followed by impeded diffusion provoked by the network of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments. Thus our results may complement rather than contradict those of Verkman and collaborators (, J. Cell Biol. 138:1-12). The biological consequence of the size-dependent restriction of the mobility of proteins in the cell cytoplasm is that the formation of intracellular complexes with other proteins considerably reduces their mobility.},

Similar gene expression and hormonal patterns were detected in both above- and below-ground organs; however, roots responded more rapidly and accumulated higher levels of defence-related hormones than leaves. Leaf and root infection with C. graminicola triggered systemic resistance in the foliage against the same fungus. This systemic defence response was associated with systemic transcriptional adaptations, and elevated levels of salicylic acid and abscisic acid. Metabolomic profiling revealed significant differences in the composition of secondary metabolites in leaves and roots, indicating that these organs employ distinct chemical defence systems. In addition, higher basal levels of antimicrobial flavonoids suggest an enhanced basal defensive state of roots.

A double Gaussian fitted simultaneously to grain number and weight data from two contrasting elite lines (Renesansa, listed in Serbia, Ppd-D1a, Rht8; Savannah, listed in UK, Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b) identified peak periods of main stem susceptibility centred on 3 (s.e.= 0.82) and 18 (s.e. = 0.55) days (mean daily temperature = 14.3oC) pre-GS 65 for both cultivars. Severity of effect depended on genotype, growth stage and their interaction: grain set relative to that achieved at 20/15oC dropped below 80\% for Savannah at booting and Renesansa at anthesis. Savannah was relatively tolerant to heat stress at anthesis. A further experiment including 62 lines of the mapping, doubled-haploid progeny of Renesansa x Savannah found tolerance at anthesis to be associated with Ppd-D1b, Rht-D1b, and a QTL from Renesansa on chromosome 2A. None of the relevant markers were associated with tolerance during booting. Rht8 was never associated with heat stress tolerance, a lack of effect confirmed in a further experiment where Rht8 was included in a comparison of near isogenic lines in a cv. Paragon background. Some compensatory increases in mean grain weight were observed, but only when stress was applied during booting and only where Ppd-D1a was absent.},

Nowadays, yield safety has gained more importance because of the forecasted climatic changes. Drought and high temperature are especially considered as key stress factors with high potential impact on crop yield. Yield safety can only be improved if future breeding attempts will be based on the valuable new knowledge acquired on the processes determining plant development and its responses to stress. Plant stress responses are very complex. Interactions between plant structure, function and the environment need to be investigated at various phases of plant development at the organismal, cellular as well as molecular levels in order to obtain a full picture. The results achieved so far in this field indicate that various plant organs, in a definite hierarchy and in interaction with each other, are involved in determining crop yield under stress. Here we attempt to summarize the currently available information on cereal reproduction under drought and heat stress and to give an outlook towards potential strategies to improve yield safety in cereals.},

This provides a means to take the developmental analysis of cellular organization in complex organisms beyond qualitative descriptions~and provides data-driven approaches to inferring cellular function. The bridging of a structure\textendash{}function relationship in hypocotyl epidermal cell patterning through global topological analysis provides support for this approach. The analysis of cellular topologies from patterning mutants further enables the contribution of gene activity toward the organizational properties of tissues to be linked, bridging molecular and tissue scales.

The cuticular membranes of fruit had much higher permeance and diffusion coefficients than leaf cuticular membranes from either trees or herbs. Both diffusion and partition coefficients increased with increasing membrane thickness. Thin cuticles, therefore, tend to be better and more efficient water barriers than thick cuticles. We compared the diffusion coefficients and the water content of cuticles as calculated from transport measurements with those obtained from water vapor sorption. There is good to fair agreement for cuticular membranes with a low water content, but large discrepancies appear for polymer matrix membranes with high permeance. This is probably due to the fact that diffusion coefficients obtained from transport measurements on membranes with high permeance and water content are underestimated. Water permeabilities of polyethylene and polypropylene membranes are similar to those of leaf cuticular membranes. However, leaf cuticles have much lower diffusion coefficients and a much greater water content than these synthetic polymers. This suggests that cuticles are primarily mobility barriers as far as water transport is concerned.},

  abstract = {The authors present a comprehensive overview of image processing and analysis work done to support research into the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Beside the plant's importance in biological research, using image analysis to obtain experimental measurements of it is an interesting vision problem in its own right, involving the segmentation and analysis of sequences of images of objects whose shape varies between individual specimens and also changes over time. While useful measurements can be obtained by segmenting a whole plant from the background, they suggest that the increased range and precision of measurements made available by leaf-level segmentation makes this a problem well worth solving. A variety of approaches have been tried by biologists as well as computer vision researchers. This is an interdisciplinary area and the computer vision community has an important contribution to make. They suggest that there is a need for publicly available datasets with ground truth annotations to enable the evaluation of new approaches and to support the building of training data for modern data-driven computer vision approaches, which are those most likely to result in the kind of fully automated systems that will be of use to biologists.},

Although mobile signals are known to be important in lateral root development, the role of plasmodesmata (PD)-mediated transport in this process has not been investigated. Here, we show that changes in symplastic connectivity accompany and regulate lateral root organogenesis in Arabidopsis. This connectivity is dependent upon callose deposition around PD affecting molecular flux through the channel. Two plasmodesmal-localized {$\beta$}-1,3 glucanases (PdBGs) were identified that regulate callose accumulation and the number and distribution of lateral roots. The fundamental role of PD-associated callose in this process was illustrated by the induction of similar phenotypes in lines with altered callose turnover. Our results show that regulation of callose and cell-to-cell connectivity is critical in determining the pattern of lateral root formation, which influences root architecture and optimal plant performance.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether the unique physical milieu just beneath the cell plasma membrane influences the rheology of fluid-phase cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic viscosity was evaluated from the picosecond rotation of the small fluorophore 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) by parallel-acquisition Fourier transform microfluorimetry (Fushimi and Verkman, 1991). Information about viscosity within  200 nm of cell plasma membranes was obtained by selective excitation of fluorophores in an evanescent field created by total internal reflection (TIR) of impulse-modulated s-plane-polarized laser illumination (488 nm) at a glass-aqueous interface. Measurements of fluorescence lifetime and time-resolved anisotropy were carried out in solutions containing fluorescein or BCECF at known viscosities, and monolayers of BCECF-labeled Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Specific concerns associated with time-resolved fluorescence measurements in the evanescent field were examined theoretically and/or experimentally, including variations in lifetime due to fluorophore proximity to the interface, and the use of the s and p polarized excitation. In fluorescein solutions excited with s-plane polarized light, there was a 5\textendash{}10\% decrease in fluorescein lifetime with TIR compared to trans (subcritical) illumination, but no change in rotational correlation time (approximately 98 ps/cP). Intracellular BCECF had a single lifetime of 3.7 +/- 0.1 ns near the cell plasma membrane. Apparent fluid-phase viscosity near the cell plasma membrane was 1.1 +/- 0.2 cP (fibroblast) and 1.0 +/- 0.2 cP (MDCK), not significantly different from the viscosity measured in bulk cytoplasm far from the plasma membrane. The results establish the methodology for time-resolved microfluorimetric measurement of polarization in the evanescent field and demonstrate that the cell plasma membrane has little effect on the fluid-phase viscosity of adjacent cytoplasm. \textcopyright{} 1993, The Biophysical Society.

Deep learning has the potential to improve cancer detection rates, but its applicability to melanoma detection is compromised by the limitations of the available skin lesion databases, which are small, heavily imbalanced, and contain images with occlusions. We propose a complete deep learning system for lesion segmentation and classification that utilizes networks specialized in data purification and augmentation. It contains the processing unit for removing image occlusions and the data generation unit for populating scarce lesion classes, or equivalently creating virtual patients with pre-defined types of lesions. We empirically verify our approach and show superior performance over common baselines.},

Selective in vitro use of radiolabeled ATP analogs by -as kinases can be exploited to identify the direct phosphorylation targets of individual kinases in complex extracts. In organisms in which it is practical to replace wild-type kinase genes with engineered alleles, the in vivo activity of a -as kinase can be reversibly blocked with an allele-specific inhibitor. Thus, analog-sensitive kinases can be effective tools for discovery of the cellular functions and phosphorylation targets of individual enzymes. A theoretical background for the design and use of these alleles is discussed, as are strategies for construction of candidate -as alleles of any kinase.},

This communication has to be tightly regulated to ensure that cellular components such as organelles, macromolecules, hormones, or viruses leave the cell in a precisely organized way. During evolution, plants, animals, and fungi have developed similar ways of responding to this biological challenge. For example, in higher plants, plasmodesmata connect adjacent cells and allow communication to regulate differentiation and development. In animals, two main general structures that enable short- and long-range intercellular communication are known, namely gap junctions and tunneling nanotubes, respectively. Finally, filamentous fungi have also developed specialized structures called septal pores that allow intercellular communication via cytoplasmic flow. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms for intercellular communication in these three eukaryotic groups and discusses its consequences for the regulation of differentiation and developmental processes.},

Here we show that the Multiple C2 domains and Transmembrane region Protein (MCTP) family, key regulators of cell-to-cell signalling in plants, act as ER - PM tethers specifically at plasmodesmata. We report that MCTPs are core plasmodesmata proteins that insert into the ER via their transmembrane region whilst their C2 domains dock to the PM through interaction with anionic phospholipids. A mctp3/4 loss-of-function mutant induces plant developmental defects while MCTP4 expression in a yeast {$\Delta$}tether mutant partially restores ER-PM tethering. Our data suggest that MCTPs are unique membrane tethers controlling both ER-PM contacts and cell-cell signalling.},

This paper reports QTL analyses of kernel morphology in two hexaploid wheat mapping populations, grown in NY and CA. Kernel morphology was evaluated through a new and improved method, combining measurements from two orthogonal pictures. Single marker regression showed that several genomic positions, scattered through the genome, were related to kernel size and shape, in both populations. The direction of allele effects was consistent between environments, although the LOD scores varied considerably. Composite interval mapping revealed QTLs on all seven homoeologous groups, considering both populations. For the QTLs detected through this method, the signal and magnitude of additive effects were similar between environments, indicating small QTL \texttimes{} environment interaction. In the population W7984 \texttimes{} Opata 85, the strongest signal was detected on the chromosome 5B, for kernel length. In the population AC Reed \texttimes{} Grandin, the most important QTLs were detected on chromosome 2D, affecting the lateral dimensions of the kernel. This study agreed with previous reports that the genetic control of kernel length and width are largely independent. Additionally, it was shown that QTLs detected on different mapping populations, with identical evaluation methods, can be very distinct. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

One of the most serious difficulties for genetic research is the enormous phenotypic heterogeneity of psychiatric illnesses. As a response to this problem, geneticists have searched for alternative strategies to identify those individuals at genetic risk for developing the disorder. One approach is to use endophenotypes or intermediate traits. Gottesman and Gould (2003), in their discussion of endophenotypes, suggest five criteria that should be characteristic of a trait in order for it to qualify as an endophenotype. These five criteria are used in order to assess the viability of using measures of neuropsychological dysfunction as endophenotypes for genetic studies of bipolar disorder. A review of the literature suggests that executive dysfunction is characteristic of people with bipolar disorder in both the acute and chronic stages of the illness, that neurocognitive function is influenced by genetic factors and that neuropsychological deficits have been reported in the nonaffected relatives of bipolar probands. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether neuropsychological dysfunction co-segregates with affectively ill individuals. We conclude that the use of neurocognitive markers of bipolar illness suffers from a number of serious drawbacks but given the absence of more appropriate endophenotypes, the neuropsychological profiling of probands and their relatives may nevertheless prove to be a worthwhile exercise.

Several studies have linked PD transport to chloroplast-centered signaling networks, but the physiological significance of this connection remains unclear. Here, we show that PD transport is strongly regulated by light and the circadian clock. Light promotes PD transport during the day, but light is not sufficient to increase rates of PD transport at night, suggesting a circadian gating mechanism. Silencing expression of the core circadian clock gene, LHY/CCA1, allows light to strongly promote PD transport during subjective night, confirming that the canonical plant circadian clock controls the PD transport light response. We conclude that PD transport is dynamically regulated during the day/night cycle. Due to the many roles of PD in plant biology, this discovery has strong implications for plant development, physiology, and pathogenesis.},

Although fundamental to plant physiology, the mechanisms that control PD transport and thereby support development of new leaves have remained elusive. From a forward genetic screen for altered PD transport, we discovered that the conserved eukaryotic glucose-TOR (TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN) metabolic signaling network restricts PD transport in leaves. Genetic approaches and chemical or physiological treatments to either promote or disrupt TOR activity demonstrate that glucose-activated TOR decreases PD transport in leaves. We further found that TOR is significantly more active in mature leaves photosynthesizing excess sugars than in young, growing leaves, and that this increase in TOR activity correlates with decreased rates of PD transport. We conclude that leaf cells regulate PD trafficking in response to changing carbohydrate availability monitored by the TOR pathway.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a central process in plant immunity. The induction or repression of defense genes is orchestrated by signaling networks that are directed by plant hormones of which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are the major players. Extensive cross-communication between the hormone signaling pathways allows for fine tuning of transcriptional programs, determining resistance to invaders and trade-offs with plant development. Here, we give an overview of how SA can control transcriptional reprogramming of JA-induced genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. SA can influence activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators by post-translational modifications of transcription factors and co-regulators. SA-induced redox changes, mediated by thioredoxins and glutaredoxins, modify transcriptional regulators that are involved in suppression of JA-dependent genes, such as NPR1 and TGA transcription factors, which affects their localization or DNA binding activity. Furthermore, SA can mediate sequestering of JA-responsive transcription factors away from their target genes by stalling them in the cytosol or in complexes with repressor proteins in the nucleus. SA also affects JA-induced transcription by inducing degradation of transcription factors with an activating role in JA signaling, as was shown for the ERF transcription factor ORA59. Additionally, SA can induce negative regulators, among which WRKY transcription factors, that can directly or indirectly inhibit JA-responsive gene expression. Finally, at the DNA level, modification of histones by SA-dependent factors can result in repression of JA-responsive genes. These diverse and complex regulatory mechanisms affect important signaling hubs in the integration of hormone signaling networks. Some pathogens have evolved effectors that highjack hormone crosstalk mechanisms for their own good, which are described in this review as well.},

Although sRNA trafficking has been observed in a wide variety of interactions, how sRNAs are transferred, especially from hosts to pathogens and pests, is still unknown. Here, we show that host Arabidopsis cells secrete exosome-like extracellular vesicles to deliver sRNAs into fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. These sRNA-containing vesicles accumulate at the infection sites and are taken up by the fungal cells. Transferred host sRNAs induce silencing of fungal genes critical for pathogenicity. Thus, Arabidopsis has adapted exosome-mediated cross-kingdom RNA interference as part of its immune responses during the evolutionary arms race with the pathogen. S mall RNAs (sRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that silence genes with complementary sequences (1). Within an animal, sRNAs can be transported by extracellular vesicles, specific transmembrane proteins, high-density lipoprotein complexes, or gap junctions (2). Within a plant, sRNAs move from cell to cell, presumably through plasmodesmata, and travel systemically through vasculature (3). Remarkably, sRNAs also move between hosts and interacting organisms and induce gene silencing, a phenomenon called cross-kingdom/organism RNA interference (RNAi) (4-10). But how do mobile sRNAs travel across the boundaries between organisms of different taxonomic kingdoms? The gastro-intestinal parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus secretes exosomes, a class of extracellular vesicles, to transport microRNAs (miRNAs) into mam-malian cells to suppress host immunity (7). By contrast, the mechanism by which sRNAs are transported from hosts to interacting pathogens and pests is totally unknown. To investigate how host sRNAs move into interacting fungal cells and identify plant endogenous transferred sRNAs, we used the Arabidopsis-Botrytis cinerea pathosystem that displays bi-directional sRNA trafficking and cross-kingdom RNAi (6, 8, 11, 12). Because the cell wall compositions of plants and fungi are different, we developed a sequential protoplast purification method to isolate pure fungal cells from infected tissues (fig. S1). sRNA profiling of purified B. cinerea protoplasts identified 42 Arabidopsis sRNAs in all three biological replicates, using 40 normalized reads per million total reads as a cutoff (table S1). We performed sRNA profiling on total RNAs of Arabidopsis leaves as a control. Although the more abundant sRNAs were more likely to be transported (table S2), there is a clear selection in transferred sRNAs. Among the 42 transferred Arabidopsis sRNAs, 25 were lowly abundant and not among the top 100 sRNAs in the total sRNA libraries (tables S2 and S3). Despite being generated from the same TAS1c mRNA precursor and belong to the top 20 most abundant sRNAs from the total sRNA libraries, transacting small interfering RNA locus 1C-derived siRNA483 (TAS1c-siR483) but not TAS1c-siR585 was enriched in the fungal protoplasts (tables S2 and S3). Similarly , although TAS2-siR710 had 30 times higher reads in the total sRNA libraries than TAS2-siR453 that derived from the same TAS2 precursor , only TAS2-siR453 was present in the fungal protoplasts. Furthermore, Arabidopsis hetero-chromatic sRNAs that derived from intergenic regions, such as IGN-siR1 but not IGN-siR107, were enriched in B. cinerea cells, although IGN-siR107 accumulated to a higher level in the total sRNA libraries (tables S2 and S3). These results were validated by means of sRNA reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 1A). Thus, host cells transferring endogenous sRNAs into fungal cells are not simply through concentration-dependent diffusion but possibly through a more selective process. Extracellular vesicles are implicated in systemic sRNA transport in animals (13). To test whether plants secrete vesicles to transfer sRNAs into fungal cells, we profiled vesicle sRNAs isolated from the extracellular apoplastic fluids of infected leaves. In all three biological replicates, TAS1c-siR483, TAS2-siR453, and IGN-siR1 accumulated to higher levels than TAS1c-siR585, TAS2-siR710, and IGN-siR107, respectively (Fig. 1B and tables S2 and S4). This was similar to fungal protoplast results. Of the 42 transferred host sRNAs, 31 (73.8\%) were present in vesicle libraries (table S4). These results support a positive correlation between the sRNA profiles from extracellular vesicles and the fungal cells. Nuclease protection assay showed that transferred host sRNAs were protected from nuclease digestion unless vesicles were ruptured with Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) (Fig. 1C) (7, 14), confirming that transferred sRNAs are indeed inside the vesicles instead of bound to the surface. These Fig. 1. Plant endogenous sRNAs are transferred into fungal cells via extracellular vesicles. (A) TAS1c-siR483, TAS2-siR453, IGN-siR1, and miRNA166 were detected by means of sRNA semiquantitative RT-PCR in B. cinerea protoplasts purified from B. cinerea-infected Col-0 Arabidopsis (Bc Col). As a negative control, cultured B. cinerea mixed with uninfected leaves was subjected to the same procedure (Bc Ctrl). (B) These host sRNAs were also in Arabidopsis extracellular vesicles. (C) Arabidopsis sRNAs were detected in micrococcal nuclease-treated extracellular vesicles. In (A) to (C), TAS1c-siR585, TAS2-siR710, IGN-siR107, miRNA822, and Actin genes were used as controls. The "total" lane indicates total RNAs from leaves. Similar results were obtained from two biological replicates.},

How Six5 participates in triggering resistance is unknown. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays we found that Avr2 and Six5 interact at plasmodesmata. Single-cell transformation revealed that a 2xRFP marker protein and Avr2-GFP only move to neighboring cells in the presence of Six5. Six5 alone does not alter plasmodesmatal transduction as 2xRFP was only translocated in the presence of both effectors. In SIX5-expressing transgenic plants, the distribution of virally expressed Avr2-GFP, and subsequent onset of I-2-mediated cell death, differed from that in wild-type tomato. Taken together, our data show~that in the presence of Six5, Avr2 moves from cell to cell, which in susceptible plants contributes to virulence, but in I-2 containing plants induces resistance.},

However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.},

D'Arcy Thompson emphasised the importance of surface tension as a potential driving force in establishing cell shape and topology within tissues. Leaf epidermal pavement cells grow into jigsaw-piece shapes, highly deviating from such classical forms. We investigate the topology of developing Arabidopsis leaves composed solely of pavement cells. Image analysis of around 50,000 cells reveals a clear and unique topological signature, deviating from previously studied epidermal tissues. This topological distribution is established early during leaf development, already before the typical pavement cell shapes emerge, with topological homeostasis maintained throughout growth and unaltered between division and maturation zones. Simulating graph models, we identify a heuristic cellular division rule that reproduces the observed topology. Our parsimonious model predicts how and when cells effectively place their division plane with respect to their neighbours. We verify the predicted dynamics through in vivo tracking of 800 mitotic events, and conclude that the distinct topology is not a direct consequence of the jigsaw piece-like shape of the cells, but rather owes itself to a strongly life history-driven process, with limited impact from cell-surface mechanics.},

Molecular genetics and archaeological data have allowed the reconstruction of plausible domestication scenarios leading to modern cultivars. For diploid einkorn and tetraploid durum wheat, a single domestication event has likely occurred in the Karacadag Mountains, Turkey. Following a cross between tetraploid durum and diploid T. tauschii, the resultant hexaploid bread wheat was domesticated and disseminated around the Caucasian region. These polyploidisation events facilitated wheat domestication and created genetic bottlenecks, which excluded potentially adaptive alleles. With the urgent need to accelerate genetic progress to confront the challenges of climate change and sustainable agriculture, wild ancestors and old landraces represent a reservoir of underexploited genetic diversity that may be utilized through modern breeding methods. Understanding domestication processes may thus help identifying new strategies. \textcopyright{} 2011 Acad{\'e}mie des sciences.},

The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5 years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48 359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35 846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43\% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes.

Here we have used the fungal elicitor chitin to investigate signal integration and responses at the plasmodesmal PM. We found that the plasmodesmal PM employs a receptor complex composed of the LysM receptors LYM2 and LYK4 which respectively change their location and interactions in response to chitin. Downstream, signalling is transmitted via a specific phosphorylation signature of an NADPH oxidase and localised callose synthesis that causes plasmodesmata closure. This demonstrates the plasmodesmal PM deploys both plasmodesmata-specific components and differential activation of PM-common components to independently integrate an immune signal.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Outlook 66 Acknowledgements 66 References 66 SUMMARY: Plasmodesmata (PD) are plasma membrane-lined pores that connect neighbouring plant cells, bridging the cell wall and establishing cytoplasmic and membrane continuity between cells. PD are dynamic structures regulated by callose deposition in a variety of stress and developmental contexts. This process crudely controls the aperture of the pore and thus the flux of molecules between cells. During pathogen infection, plant cells initiate a range of immune responses and it was recently identified that, following perception of fungal and bacterial pathogens, plant cells initially close their PD. Systemic defence responses depend on the spread of signals between cells, raising questions about whether PD are in different functional states during different immune responses. It is well established that viral pathogens exploit PD to spread between cells, but it has more recently been identified that protein effectors secreted by fungal pathogens can spread between host cells via PD. It is possible that many classes of pathogens specifically target PD to aid infection, which would infer antagonistic regulation of PD by host and pathogen. How PD regulation benefits both host immune responses and pathogen infection is an important question and demands that we examine the multicellular nature of plant-pathogen interactions.},

A procedure is established to calculate optimal arrangements of N{$\gg$}1 equal small boundary traps that minimize the asymptotic MFPT. Based on observed characteristics of such arrangements, a remarkable property is discovered, that is, the sum of squared pairwise distances between optimally arranged N traps on a unit sphere is integer, equal to N2. It is observed for 2{$\leq$}N{$\leq$}1004 with high precision. It is conjectured that this is the case for such optimal arrangements for all N. A dilute trap limit of homogenization theory when N\textrightarrow{$\infty$} can be used to replace the strongly heterogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann MFPT problem with a spherically symmetric Robin problem for which an exact solution is readily found. Parameters of the Robin homogenization problem are computed that capture the first four terms of the asymptotic MFPT. Close agreement of asymptotic and homogenization MFPT values is demonstrated. The homogenization approach provides a radically faster way to estimate the MFPT since it is given by a simple formula and does not involve expensive global optimization to determine locations of N{$\gg$}1 boundary traps.},

  abstract = {Plants show a rapid systemic response to a wide range of environmental stresses, where the signals from the site of stimulus perception are transmitted to distal organs to elicit plant-wide responses. A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling (`trio signaling') appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H+ remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.},

During Arabidopsis development, the intercellular movement of SHORTROOT (SHR) and subsequent interaction with its downstream target SCARECROW (SCR) control root patterning and cell fate specification. However, quantitative information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of SHR movement and SHR-SCR interaction is currently unavailable. Here, we quantify parameters including SHR mobility, oligomeric state, and association with SCR using a combination of Fluorescent Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) techniques. We then incorporate these parameters into a mathematical model of SHR and SCR, which shows that SHR reaches a steady state in minutes, while SCR and the SHR-SCR complex reach a steady-state between 18 and 24 hr. Our model reveals the timing of SHR and SCR dynamics and allows us to understand how protein movement and protein-protein stoichiometry contribute to development.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

Besides sharing striking convergences and similarities in the overall evolutionary organization of their innate immune systems, both plants and animals can respond to infection and pathogen recognition with programmed cell death. The fact that plant and animal pathogens have evolved strategies to subvert specific cell death modalities emphasizes the essential role of cell death during immune responses. The hypersensitive response (HR) cell death in plants displays morphological features, molecular architectures and mechanisms reminiscent of different inflammatory cell death types in animals (pyroptosis and necroptosis). In this review, we describe the molecular pathways leading to cell death during innate immune responses. Additionally, we present recently discovered caspase and caspase-like networks regulating cell death that have revealed fascinating analogies between cell death control across both kingdoms.},

  abstract = {Plant cells rely on plasmodesmata for intercellular transport of small signaling molecules as well as larger informational macromolecules such as proteins. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter and low-pressure microprojectile bombardment were used to quantify the degree of symplastic continuity between cells of the leaf at different developmental stages and under different growth conditions. Plasmodesmata were observed to be closed to the transport of GFP or dilated to allow the traffic of GFP. In sink leaves, between 34\% and 67\% of the cells transport GFP (27 kD), and between 30\% and 46\% of the cells transport double GFP (54 kD). In leaves in transition transport was reduced; between 21\% and 46\% and between 2\% and 9\% of cells transport single and double GFP, respectively. Thus, leaf age dramatically affects the ability of cells to exchange proteins nonselectively. Further, the number of cells allowing GFP or double GFP movement was sensitive to growth conditions because greenhouse-grown plants exhibited higher diffusion rates than culture-grown plants. These studies reveal that leaf cell plasmodesmata are dynamic and do not have a set size exclusion limit. We also examined targeted movement of the movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus fused to GFP, P30::GFP. This 58-kD fusion protein localizes to plasmodesmata, consistently transits from up to 78\% of transfected cells, and was not sensitive to developmental age or growth conditions. The relative number of cells containing dilated plasmodesmata varies between different species of tobacco, with Nicotiana clevelandii exhibiting greater diffusion of proteins thanNicotiana tabacum.},

  abstract = {We described advection and diffusion of water isotopologues in leaves in the non-steady state, applied specifically to amphistomatous leaves. This explains the isotopic enrichment of leaf water from the xylem to the mesophyll, and we showed how it relates to earlier models of leaf water enrichment in non-steady state. The effective length or tortuosity factor of isotopologue movement in leaves is unknown and, therefore, is a fitted parameter in the model. We compared the advection-diffusion model to previously published data sets for Lupinus angustifolius and Eucalyptus globulus. Night-time stomatal conductance was not measured in either data set and is therefore another fitted parameter. The model compared very well with the observations of bulk mesophyll water during the whole diel cycle. It compared well with the enrichment at the evaporative sites during the day but showed some deviations at night for E. globulus. It became clear from our analysis that night-time stomatal conductance should be measured in the future and that the temperature dependence of the tracer diffusivities should be accounted for. However, varying mesophyll water volume did not seem critical for obtaining a good prediction of leaf water enrichment, at least in our data sets. In addition, observations of single diurnal cycles do not seem to constrain the effective length that relates to the tortuosity of the water path in the mesophyll. Finally, we showed when simpler models of leaf water enrichment were suitable for applications of leaf water isotopes once weighted with the appropriate gas exchange flux. We showed that taking an unsuitable leaf water enrichment model could lead to large biases when cumulated over only 1 day.},

Using a combination of X?ray computed tomography (CT) and image?based modelling, we tested the accuracy of this spatial averaging by directly calculating plant water uptake for young wheat plants in two soil types. The root system was imaged using X?ray CT at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 d after transplanting. The roots were segmented using semi?automated root tracking for speed and reproducibility. The segmented geometries were converted to a mesh suitable for the numerical solution of Richards' equation. Richards' equation was parameterized using existing pore scale studies of soil hydraulic properties in the rhizosphere of wheat plants. Image?based modelling allows the spatial distribution of water around the root to be visualized and the fluxes into the root to be calculated. By comparing the results obtained through image?based modelling to spatially averaged models, the impact of root architecture and geometry in water uptake was quantified. We observed that the spatially averaged models performed well in comparison to the image?based models with 2\% difference in uptake. However, the spatial averaging loses important information regarding the spatial distribution of water near the root system.},

However, in many regions of the world, their production has been adversely affected by drought. Although water scarcity is a severe abiotic constraint of legume crops productivity, it remains unclear how the effects of drought co-vary with legume species, soil texture, agroclimatic region, and drought timing. To address these uncertainties, we collected literature data between 1980 and 2014 that reported monoculture legume yield responses to drought under field conditions, and analyzed this data set using meta-analysis techniques. Our results showed that the amount of water reduction was positively related with yield reduction, but the extent of the impact varied with legume species and the phenological state during which drought occurred. Overall, lentil (Lens culinaris), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) were found to experience lower drought-induced yield reduction compared to legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and green gram (Vigna radiate). Yield reduction was generally greater when legumes experienced drought during their reproductive stage compared to during their vegetative stage. Legumes grown in soil with medium texture also exhibited greater yield reduction compared to those planted on soil of either coarse or fine texture. In contrast, regions and their associated climatic factors did not significantly affect legume yield reduction. In the face of changing climate, our study provides useful information for agricultural planning and research directions for development of drought-resistant legume species to improve adaptation and resilience of agricultural systems in the drought-prone regions of the world.},

Cell-to-cell mobility of fluorescent molecules and PD dimensions (measured from electron micrographs) are both used as methods to predict PD transport capacity (i.e., effective symplasmic permeability), but often yield very different values. Here, we build a theoretical bridge between both experimental approaches by calculating the effective symplasmic permeability from a geometrical description of individual PDs and considering the flow towards them. We find that a dilated central region has the strongest impact in thick cell walls and that clustering of PDs into pit fields strongly reduces predicted permeabilities. Moreover, our open source multi-level model allows to predict PD dimensions matching measured permeabilities and add a functional interpretation to structural differences observed between PDs in different cell walls.},

The aim of this paper is to examine the genotypic variability of leaf chlorophyll, stem water-soluble carbohydrate content and carbon isotope discrimination ( 13?

The study was performed on a large collection of 384 wheat genotypes grown under water stress (WS, rainfed), mild water stress (MWS, deficit irrigation), and full irrigation (FI). The average GY of two growing seasons was 2.4, 4.8, and 8.9 Mg ha-1 under WS, MWS, and FI, respectively. Chlorophyll content at anthesis was positively correlated with GY(except under FI in 2011) and the agronomical components kernels per spike (KS) and thousand kernel weight (TKW). The WSC content at anthesis (WSCCa) was negatively correlated with spikes per square meter (SM2), but positively correlated with KS and TKW underWSand FI conditions. As a consequence, the relationships between WSCCa with GY were low or not significant. Therefore, selecting for high stem WSC would not necessary lead to genotypes of GY potential. The relationship between 13? C and GY was positive under FI andMWSbut negative under severeWS(in 2011), indicating higher water use under yield potential and MWS conditions.},

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming a cornerstone of developmental research, providing unprecedented power in understanding dynamic processes. Here, we present a high-resolution scRNA-seq expression atlas of the Arabidopsis root composed of thousands of independently profiled cells. This atlas provides detailed spatiotemporal information, identifying defining expression features for all major cell types, including the scarce cells of the quiescent center. These reveal key developmental regulators and downstream genes that translate cell fate into distinctive cell shapes and functions. Developmental trajectories derived from pseudotime analysis depict a finely resolved cascade of cell progressions from the niche through differentiation that are supported by mirroring expression waves of highly interconnected transcription factors. This study demonstrates the power of applying scRNA-seq to plants and provides an unparalleled spatiotemporal perspective of root cell differentiation.},

Although altered expression of cell-cycle genes frequently leads to altered organ growth, there are many examples where manipulation of the division machinery leads to a limited outcome at the level of organ form, despite changes in constituent cell size. One possibility, which has been under-explored, is that altered division patterns resulting from manipulation of cell-cycle gene expression alter the physiology of the organ, and that this has an effect on growth. We performed a series of experiments on retinoblastoma-related protein (RBR), a well characterized regulator of the cell cycle, to investigate the outcome of altered cell division on leaf physiology. Our approach involved combination of high-resolution microCT imaging and physiological analysis with a transient gene induction system, providing a powerful approach for the study of developmental physiology. Our investigation identifies a new role for RBR in mesophyll differentiation that affects tissue porosity and the distribution of air space within the leaf. The data demonstrate the importance of RBR in early leaf development and the extent to which physiology adapts to modified cellular architecture resulting from altered cell-cycle gene expression.},

It is becoming clear from genomic and physiological investigations that while the basic elements in the toolkit are common between plants and animals, evolution has acted in such a way that, in plants, some components have diversified with respect to their animal counterparts, while others have either been lost or have never evolved in the plant lineages. In comparison with animals, in plants there appears to have been a loss of diversity in calcium-influx mechanisms at the plasma membrane. However, the evolution of the calcium-storing vacuole may provide plants with additional possibilities for regulating calcium influx into the cytosol. Among the proteins that are involved in sensing and responding to increases in calcium, plants possess specific decoder proteins that are absent from the animal lineage. In seeking to understand the selection pressures that shaped the plant calcium-signalling toolkit, we consider the evolution of fast electrical signalling. We also note that, in contrast to animals, plants apparently do not make extensive use of cyclic-nucleotide-based signalling. It is possible that reliance on a single intracellular second-messenger-based system, coupled with the requirement to adapt to changing environmental conditions, has helped to define the diversity of components found in the extant plant calcium-signalling toolkit.},

Despite its importance in main- taining plant integrity and plant defence, knowledge about the regulation of callose biosynthesis at its diverse sites of action within the plant is still limited. The moderately sized family of GSL (GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE) genes is predicted to encode callose synthases with a specific biological function and subcellular localization. Phosphorylation and directed translocation of callose synthases seem to be key post-translational mechanisms of enzymatic regulation, whereas transcriptional control of GSL genes might only have a minor function in response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Scope and Conclusions: Among the different sites of callose biosynthesis within the plant, particular attention has beenfocusedontheformation of callose in responsetopathogenattack.Here, callose isdepositedbetweentheplasma membrane and the cellwall to act as a physical barrier to stop or slowinvading pathogens. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is one of the best-studied models not only for general plant defence responses but also for the regulation of pathogen-induced callose biosynthesis. Callose synthase GSL5 (GLUCANSYNTHASE\textendash{}LIKE5) has been shown to be responsible for stress-induced callose deposition.Within the last decade of research into stress-induced callose, growing evidence has been found that the timing of callose deposition in the multilayered system of plant defence responses could be the key parameter for optimal effectiveness. This timing seems to be achieved through co-ordi- nated transport and formation of the callose synthase complex.},

The vast majority of 250,000 angiosperm plant species have flowers with a conserved organ plan bearing sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels in the center. The combinatorial model for the activity of the so-called ABC homeotic floral genes has guided extensive experimental studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plant species. However, a mechanistic and dynamical explanation for the ABC model and prevalence among flowering plants is lacking. Here, we put forward a simple discrete model that postulates logical rules that formally summarize published ABC and non-ABC gene interaction data for Arabidopsis floral organ cell fate determination and integrates this data into a dynamic network model. This model shows that all possible initial conditions converge to few steady gene activity states that match gene expression profiles observed experimentally in primordial floral organ cells of wild-type and mutant plants. Therefore, the network proposed here provides a dynamical explanation for the ABC model and shows that precise signaling pathways are not required to restrain cell types to those found in Arabidopsis, but these are rather determined by the overall gene network dynamics. Furthermore, we performed robustness analyses that clearly show that the cell types recovered depend on the network architecture rather than on specific values of the model's gene interaction parameters. These results support the hypothesis that such a network constitutes a developmental module, and hence provide a possible explanation for the overall conservation of the ABC model and overall floral plan among angiosperms. In addition, we have been able to predict the effects of differences in network architecture between Arabidopsis and Petunia hybrida.},

  abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) plays an integral role in a vast array of signalling pathways within both animals
and plants. The study of these pathways has proven to be a fruitful avenue of research
for experimental biologists and mathematical modellers. While the signalling processes have
been well studied in animals, the same cannot be said of plants. This work takes a mathematical
look at two important Ca2+ signalling pathways in plants, with a focus on how these
signals are generated.
Nuclear Ca2+ oscillations in legumes occur at a key step in the development of symbioses.
The oscillations occur both inside the nucleus and in the perinuclear cytoplasm, and are
temporally coordinated. We present and develop a model for simulating diffusion on the
surface of the nucleus and relate the properties of this signalling to behaviour in the bulk. We
show that diffusion of Ca2+ through the nuclear pore complexes provides a possible mechanism
for this coordination and that this mechanism is robust to differences in Ca2+ diffusion rates
in the two compartments or to different numbers of Ca2+ channels.
Ca2+ has also been seen to propagate a wave travelling systemically through the root in
response to salt stress. This wave is essential to the transcription of stress response genes in
the leaves. We examine a range of di\dbend{}erent models for propagation of the wave, demonstrating
that a combined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ wave cooperatively propagate the
signal. The presence of this accompanying ROS wave was confirmed in experiments by our
collaborators.
The present study highlights two very different Ca2+ signals and demonstrates the value
of mathematical modelling for interpreting, understanding and furthering experimental investigations.},

We show that LYSIN MOTIF DOMAIN-CONTAINING GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL-ANCHORED PROTEIN 2 (LYM2), the Arabidopsis homolog of a rice chitin receptor-like protein, mediates a reduction in molecular flux via plasmodesmata in the presence of chitin. For this response, lym2-1 mutants are insensitive to the presence of chitin, but not to the flagellin derivative flg22. Surprisingly, the chitin-recognition receptor CHITIN ELCITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) is not required for chitin-induced changes to plasmodesmata flux, suggesting that there are at least two chitin-activated response pathways in Arabidopsis and that LYM2 is not required for CERK1-mediated chitin-triggered defense responses, indicating that these pathways are independent. In accordance with a role in the regulation of intercellular flux, LYM2 is resident at the plasma membrane and is enriched at plasmodesmata. Chitin-triggered regulation of molecular flux between cells is required for defense responses against the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, and thus we conclude that the regulation of symplastic continuity and molecular flux between cells is a vital component of chitin-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis.},

This speciation process has been associated with ecogeographical expansion and with domestication. In the past few decades, we have searched for explanations for this impressive success. Our studies attempted to probe the bases for the wide genetic variation characterizing these species, which accounts for their great adaptability and colonizing ability. Central to our work was the investigation of how allopolyploidization alters genome structure and expression. We found in wheat that allopolyploidy accelerated genome evolution in two ways: (1) it triggered rapid genome alterations through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic changes (which we termed "revolutionary" changes), and (2) it facilitated sporadic genomic changes throughout the species' evolution (i.e., evolutionary changes), which are not attainable at the diploid level. Our major findings in natural and synthetic allopolyploid wheat indicate that these alterations have led to the cytological and genetic diploidization of the allopolyploids. These genetic and epigenetic changes reflect the dynamic structural and functional plasticity of the allopolyploid wheat genome. The significance of this plasticity for the successful establishment of wheat allopolyploids, in nature and under domestication, is discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Archaeobotany, the study of plant remains from sites of ancient human activity, provides data for studying the initial evolution of domesticated plants. An important background to this is defining the domestication syndrome, those traits by which domesticated plants differ from wild relatives. These traits include features that have been selected under the conditions of cultivation. From archaeological remains the easiest traits to study are seed size and in cereal crops the loss of natural seed dispersal.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nSCOPE: The rate at which these features evolved and the ordering in which they evolved can now be documented for a few crops of Asia and Africa. This paper explores this in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) from the Near East, rice (Oryza sativa) from China, mung (Vigna radiata) and urd (Vigna mungo) beans from India, and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from west Africa. Brief reference is made to similar data on lentils (Lens culinaris), peas (Pisum sativum), soybean (Glycine max) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis). Available quantitative data from archaeological finds are compiled to explore changes with domestication. The disjunction in cereals between seed size increase and dispersal is explored, and rates at which these features evolved are estimated from archaeobotanical data. Contrasts between crops, especially between cereals and pulses, are examined.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in domesticated grasses, changes in grain size and shape evolved prior to non-shattering ears or panicles. Initial grain size increases may have evolved during the first centuries of cultivation, within perhaps 500-1000 years. Non-shattering infructescences were much slower, becoming fixed about 1000-2000 years later. This suggests a need to reconsider the role of sickle harvesting in domestication. Pulses, by contrast, do not show evidence for seed size increase in relation to the earliest cultivation, and seed size increase may be delayed by 2000-4000 years. This implies that conditions that were sufficient to select for larger seed size in Poaceae were not sufficient in Fabaceae. It is proposed that animal-drawn ploughs (or ards) provided the selection pressure for larger seeds in legumes. This implies different thresholds of selective pressure, for example in relation to differing seed ontogenetics and underlying genetic architecture in these families. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) may show some similarities to the pulses in terms of a lag-time before truly larger-grained forms evolved.},

  abstract = {Purpose
There has been considerable interest in using whole-genome expression profiles for the classification of colorectal cancer (CRC). The selection of important features is a crucial step before training a classifier.

Methods
In this study, we built a model that uses support vector machine (SVM) to classify cancer and normal samples using Affymetrix exon microarray data obtained from 90 samples of 48 patients diagnosed with CRC. From the 22,011 genes, we selected the 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 genes most relevant to CRC using the minimum-redundancy\textendash{}maximum-relevance (mRMR) technique. With these gene sets, an SVM model was designed using four different kernel types (linear, polynomial, radial basis function [RBF], and sigmoid).

Results
The best model, which used 30 genes and RBF kernel, outperformed other combinations; it had an accuracy of 84\% for both ten fold and leave-one-out cross validations in discriminating the cancer samples from the normal samples. With this 30 genes set from mRMR, six classifiers were trained using random forest (RF), Bayes net (BN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), na{\"i}ve Bayes (NB), reduced error pruning tree (REPT), and SVM. Two hybrids, mRMR + SVM and mRMR + BN, were the best models when tested on other datasets, and they achieved a prediction accuracy of 95.27\% and 91.99\%, respectively, compared to other mRMR hybrid models (mRMR + RF, mRMR + NB, mRMR + REPT, and mRMR + MLP). Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to analyze the functions of the 30 genes selected for this model and their potential association with CRC: CDH3, CEACAM7, CLDN1, IL8, IL6R, MMP1, MMP7, and TGFB1 were predicted to be CRC biomarkers.

Conclusion
This model could be used to further develop a diagnostic tool for predicting CRC based on gene expression data from patient samples.},

At the core of the complex regulatory system are spatially distinct subdomains within the shoot apex, in which cells carry out defined functions, despite highly similar phenotypes. Spatial and temporal control of these domains appears to rely on an elaborate network of phytohormone signaling, transcriptional loops and intercellular trafficking of key regulators.In this review, we aim at summarizing and connecting the mechanisms underlying the spatial organization of the shoot apical meristem and the sequence of molecular events occurring during the life of a shoot cell, from its birth towards its differentiation.},

The best understood, or so-called canonical mechanism of auxin perception ultimately results in variable adjustments of the cellular transcriptome, via a short, nuclear signal transduction pathway. Additional findings that accumulated over decades implied that an additional, presumably, cell surface-based auxin perception mechanism mediates very rapid cellular responses and decisively contributes to the cell's overall hormonal response. Recent investigations into both, nuclear and cell surface auxin signalling challenged this assumed partition of roles for different auxin signalling pathways and revealed an unexpected complexity in transcriptional and non-transcriptional cellular responses mediated by auxin.},

We undertook a large-scale quantitative analysis to determine the genetic basis of the phenotypic diversity in wheat grain morphology. A high-throughput method was used to capture grain size and shape variation in multiple mapping populations, elite varieties, and a broad collection of ancestral wheat species. This analysis reveals that grain size and shape are largely independent traits in both primitive wheat and in modern varieties. This phenotypic structure was retained across the mapping populations studied, suggesting that these traits are under the control of a limited number of discrete genetic components. We identified the underlying genes as quantitative trait loci that are distinct for grain size and shape and are largely shared between the different mapping populations. Moreover, our results show a significant reduction of phenotypic variation in grain shape in the modern germplasm pool compared with the ancestral wheat species, probably as a result of a relatively recent bottleneck. Therefore, this study provides the genetic underpinnings of an emerging phenotypic model where wheat domestication has transformed a long thin primitive grain to a wider and shorter modern grain.},

            Background
            Thorough understanding of complex model systems requires the characterisation of processes in different cell types of an organism. This can be achieved with high-throughput spatial transcriptomics at a large scale. However, for plant model systems this is still challenging as suitable transcriptomics methods are sparsely available. Here we present Grid-seq, an easy to adopt, micro-scale spatial-transcriptomics workflow that allows to study expression profiles across small areas of plant tissue at a fraction of the cost of existing sequencing-based methods.
          
          
            Results
            
              We compare the Grid-seq method with widely used library preparation methods (Illumina TruSeq). In spatial experiments we show that the Grid-seq method is sensitive enough to identify expression differences across a plant organ. We further assess the spatial transcriptome response of

              leaves exposed to the bacterial molecule flagellin-22.
            
          
          
            Conclusion
            We show that our method can be used to identify known, rapidly flagellin-22 elicited genes, plant immune response pathways to bacterial attack and spatial expression patterns of genes associated with these pathways.},

  abstract = {Plasmodesmata provide symplastic continuity linking individual plant cells. However, specialized cells may be isolated, either by the absence of plasmodesmata or by down regulation of the cytoplasmic flux through these channels, resulting in the formation of symplastic domains. Maintenance of these domains may be essential for the coordination of growth and development. While cells in the center of the meristem divide slowly and remain undifferentiated, cells on the meristem periphery divide more frequently and respond to signals determining organ fate. Such symplastic domains were visualized within shoot apices of Arabidopsis, by monitoring fluorescent symplastic tracers (HPTS: 8-hydroxypyrene 1,3,6 trisulfonic acid and CF: carboxy fluorescein), Tracers were loaded through cut leaves and distributed throughout the whole plant. Confocal laser scanning microscopy on living Arabidopsis plants indicates that HPTS moves via the vascular tissue from leaves to the apex where the tracer exits the phloem and moves symplastically into surrounding cells. The distribution of HPTS was monitored in vegetative apices, and just prior to, during, and after the switch to production of flowers. The apices of vegetative plants loaded with HPTS had detectable amounts of tracer in the tunica layer of the meristem and in very young primordia, whereas the corpus of the meristem excluded tracer uptake. Fluorescence signal intensity decreased prior to the onset of flowering. Moreover, at approximately the time the plants were committed to flowering, HPTS was undetectable in the inflorescence meristem or young primordia, Later in development, after several secondary inflorescences and mature siliques appeared, inflorescence apices again showed tracer loading at levels comparable to that of vegetative apices, Thus, analysis of fluorescent tracer movement via plasmodesmata reveals there is distinct temporal and spatial regulation of symplastic domains at the apex, dependent on the developmental stage of the plant.},

As yield is related to the number of fertile florets and grains, an understanding of the basis of their generation is instrumental to raising yield. Based on (i) a strong positive association between the number of fertile florets or grains and spike dry weight at anthesis; and (ii) the finding that floret death occurs when spikes grow at maximum rate, it was always assumed that floret survival depends on the growth of the spike. However, this assumption was recently questioned, suggesting that assimilates diverted to the spike do not determine the number of florets and grains and that the onset of floret death may instead be a developmental process that is not associated with spike growth. In this study, the relationships between the fate of floret primordia and spike growth from six independent experiments that included different growing conditions (greenhouse/field experiments, growing seasons, photoperiod/shading treatments during the floret primordia phase) and diverse cultivar types (winter/spring, semi-dwarf/standard-height, photoperiod sensitive/insensitive) were re-analysed together. Onset of floret death was associated with the beginning of spike growth at the maximum rate in c. 80\% of the cases analysed; and the rate of floret death (the main determinant of floret survival) showed a negative quantitative relationship with spike weight at anthesis. As floret death and survival were shown to be linked to pre-anthesis spike growth, the strategy of focusing on traits associated with pre-anthesis spike growth when breeding to increase wheat yield potential further is valuable.},

This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

We begin with a discussion of background, perspectives and caveats for considering the neurobiology of parent-infant relationships. Then, we discuss aspects of the psychology of parenting that are significantly motivating some of the more basic neuroscience research. Following that, we discuss some of the neurohormones that are important for the regulation of social bonding, and the dysregulation of parenting with cocaine abuse. Then, we review the brain circuitry underlying parenting, proceeding from relevant rodent and nonhuman primate research to human work. Finally, we focus on a study-by-study review of functional neuroimaging studies in humans. Taken together, this research suggests that networks of highly conserved hypothalamic-midbrain-limbic-paralimbic-cortical circuits act in concert to support aspects of parent response to infants, including the emotion, attention, motivation, empathy, decision-making and other thinking that are required to navigate the complexities of parenting. Specifically, infant stimuli activate basal forebrain regions, which regulate brain circuits that handle specific nurturing and caregiving responses and activate the brain's more general circuitry for handling emotions, motivation, attention, and empathy-all of which are crucial for effective parenting. We argue that an integrated understanding of the brain basis of parenting has profound implications for mental health.},

Eight published time series of species abun- dances were used in the analysis, including data sets for: fishes, birds, mammals, stream benthos, and crabs. To test the efficacy of eigenvalue tests, we constructed 1000 randomly generated data sets for each real data set, whose means and variances were identical to the means and variances of the original data matrices. The data sets were then subjected to a principal components analysis (PCA) and eigenvalue tests used to identify significant ei- genvalues for both correlation and covariance matrix solutions. We also examined the effects of: (1) number of species (= number of variables), (2) number of samples (= rep- lication), and (3) variance structure, on the performance of the test. Using PCA's based on the correlation matrix and with sample sizes typically encountered in the field, the eigenvalue tests generally performed at the .05 level when a = .01. Slightly poorer results were obtained with the covariance matrix. Increasing the number of samples to at least three times the number of species generally gave a level coverage for an a level test (i.e., a = .05, .01). Increasing variance in the data set only affected test outcomes at levels of replication less than twice the number of species. We conclude that the eigenvalue tests can be used to detect patterns in PCA's of assemblage structure data, if the number of samples is at least three times the number of species and either a covariance or correlation matrix solution is used. It is assumed that these patterns represent ecologically meaningful patterns of variation.},

Today, you are just as likely to find him or her in a room that looks more like an office, poring over lines of code on computer screens. The use of computers in biology has radically transformed who biologists are, what they do, and how they understand life. In Life Out of Sequence, Hallam Stevens looks inside this new landscape of digital scientific work. Stevens chronicles the emergence of bioinformatics\textemdash{}the mode of working across and between biology, computing, mathematics, and statistics\textemdash{}from the 1960s to the present, seeking to understand how knowledge about life is made in and through virtual spaces. He shows how scientific data moves from living organisms into DNA sequencing machines, through software, and into databases, images, and scientific publications. What he reveals is a biology very different from the one of predigital days: a biology that includes not only biologists but also highly interdisciplinary teams of managers and workers; a biology that is more centered on DNA sequencing, but one that understands sequence in terms of dynamic cascades and highly interconnected networks. Life Out of Sequence thus offers the computational biology community welcome context for their own work while also giving the public a frontline perspective of what is going on in this rapidly changing field.},

  abstract = {Above-ground biomass (AGB) is a basic agronomic parameter for field investigation and is frequently used to indicate crop growth status, the effects of agricultural management practices, and the ability to sequester carbon above and below ground. The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas. In this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors. These results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.},

  abstract = {Many diverse biological systems are described by randomly moving particles that can be captured by traps in their environment. Examples include neurotransmitters diffusing in the synaptic cleft before binding to receptors and prey roaming an environment before capture by predators. In most cases, the traps cannot capture particles continuously. Rather, each trap must wait a transitory ``recharge'' time after capturing a particle before additional captures. This recharge time is often overlooked. In the case of instant recharge, the average number of particles captured before they escape grows linearly in the total number of particles. In stark contrast, we prove that for any nonzero recharge time, the average number of captured particles grows at most logarithmically in the total particle number. This is a fundamental effect of recharge, as it holds under very general assumptions on particle motion and spatial domain. Furthermore, we characterize the parameter regime in which a given recharge time will dramatically affect a system, allowing researchers to easily verify if they need to account for recharge in their specific system. Finally, we consider a few examples, including a neural system in which recharge reduces neurotransmitter bindings by several orders of magnitude.},

Cultivation of wild cereals such as Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) and Triticum diccocoides (wild emmer) started in southwest Asia. Despite the many studies on the origins of agriculture and plant domestication, surprisingly few studies have discussed the importance of the nutritional quality of barley and emmer wheat in their evolution. A comparison of domesticated forms of these cereals with their wild progenitors suggests an evolution towards bigger grains with higher glycemic loads in the form of higher relative starch content with lower relative protein, fiber and mineral contents. In this work we hypothesize that in addition to the simple explanation that larger grains emerged under domestication, complex and indirect effects such as increased glycemic index and sweet taste should also be taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epigenetics is defined as mechanisms that regulate gene expression without base sequence alteration. One molecular basis is considered to be DNA cytosine methylation, which reversibly modifies DNA or chromatin structures. Although its correlation with epigenetic inheritance over generations has been circumstantially shown, evidence at the gene level has been limited. The present study aims to find genes whose methylation status directly correlates with inheritance of phenotypic changes.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHODS: DNA methylation in vivo was artificially reduced by treating rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) seeds with 5-azadeoxycytidine, and the progeny were cultivated in the field for  10 years. Genomic regions with changed methylation status were screened by the methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphysm (MSAP) method, and cytosine methylation was directly scanned by the bisulfite mapping method. Pathogen infection with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, race PR2 was performed by the scissors-dip method on mature leaf blades.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nKEY RESULTS: The majority of seedlings were lethal, but some survived to maturity. One line designated as Line-2 showed a clear marker phenotype of dwarfism, which was stably inherited by the progeny over nine generations. MSAP screening identified six fragments, among which two were further characterized by DNA blot hybridization and direct methylation mapping. One clone encoding a retrotransposon gag-pol polyprotein showed a complete erasure of 5-methylcytosines in Line-2, but neither translocation nor expression of this region was detectable. The other clone encoded an Xa21-like protein, Xa21G. In wild-type plants, all cytosines were methylated within the promoter region, whereas in Line-2, corresponding methylation was completely erased throughout generations. Expression of Xa21G was not detectable in wild type but was constitutive in Line-2. When infected with X. oryzae pv. oryzae, against which Xa21 confers resistance in a gene-for-gene manner, the progeny of Line-2 were apparently resistant while the wild type was highly susceptible without Xa21G expression.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that demethylation was selective in Line-2, and that promoter demethylation abolished the constitutive silencing of Xa21G due to hypermethylation, resulting in acquisition of disease resistance. Both hypomethylation and resistant trait were stably inherited. This is a clear example of epigenetic inheritance, and supports the idea of Lamarckian inheritance which suggested acquired traits to be heritable.},

In the course of the defense response, the transcription of different sets of defense genes is controlled in a spatio-temporal manner via SA-mediated mechanisms. Interestingly, different lines of evidence indicate that SA interplays with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) in stressed plants. In this review we focus on the evidence that links SA, ROS and GSH signals to the transcriptional control of defense genes. We discuss how redox modifications of regulators and co-regulators involved in SA-mediated transcriptional responses control the temporal patterns of gene expression in response to stress. Finally, we examine how these redox sensors are coordinated with the dynamics of cellular redox changes occurring in the defense response to biotic and abiotic stress.},

  abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical hormonal regulator of plant growth and defense. To advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamic regulation of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed a high-resolution RNA-Seq time series of methyl JA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana at 15 time points over a 16-h period. Computational analysis showed that MeJA induces a burst of transcriptional activity, generating diverse expression patterns over time that partition into distinct sectors of the JA response targeting specific biological processes. The presence of transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding motifs correlated with specific TF activity during temporal MeJA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Insight into the underlying dynamic transcriptional regulation mechanisms was captured in a chronological model of the JA gene regulatory network. Several TFs, including MYB59 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early network components with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Analysis of subnetworks surrounding the TFs ORA47, RAP2.6L, MYB59 and ANAC055, using transcriptome profiling of overexpressors and mutants, provided insights into their regulatory role in defined modules of the JA network. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints and validates previously unknown regulators, and provides a valuable resource for functional studies on JA signaling components in plant defense and development.},

  abstract = {We model the motion of a receptor on the membrane surface of a synapse as free Brownian motion in a planar domain with intermittent trappings in and escapes out of corrals with narrow openings. We compute the mean confinement time of the Brownian particle in the asymptotic limit of a narrow opening and calculate the probability to exit through a given small opening, when the boundary contains more than one. Using this approach, it is possible to describe the Brownian motion of a random particle in an environment containing domains with small openings by a coarse grained diffusion process. We use the results to estimate the confinement time as a function of the parameters and also the time it takes for a diffusing receptor to be anchored at its final destination on the postsynaptic membrane, after it is inserted in the membrane. This approach provides a framework for the theoretical study of receptor trafficking on membranes. This process underlies synaptic plasticity, which relates to learning and memory. In particular, it is believed that the memory state in the brain is stored primarily in the pattern of synaptic weight values, which are controlled by neuronal activity. At a molecular level, the synaptic weight is determined by the number and properties of protein channels (receptors) on the synapse. The synaptic receptors are trafficked in and out of synapses by a diffusion process. Following their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, receptors are trafficked to their postsynaptic sites on dendrites and axons. In this model the receptors are first inserted into the extrasynaptic plasma membrane and then random walk in and out of corrals through narrow openings on their way to their final destination.},

However, few studies have examined the rationales of these enrichment analysis strategies. Using both microarray and RNA-seq data, we show that gene pairs with functional links in pathways tended to have positively correlated expression levels, which could result in an imbalance between the up- and downregulated genes in particular pathways. We then show that the imbalance could greatly reduce the statistical power for finding disease-associated pathways through the analysis of all-DE genes. Further, using gene expression profiles from five types of tumours, we illustrate that the separate analysis of up- and downregulated genes could identify more pathways that are really pertinent to phenotypic difference. In conclusion, analysing up- and downregulated genes separately is more powerful than analysing all of the DE genes together.},

Due to impacts on yield, quality and end-use, grain morphometric traits remain an important goal for modern breeding programmes and are believed to have been selected for by human populations. To directly and accurately assess the 3D characteristics of grains, we combine X-ray micro computed tomography ({$\mu$}CT) imaging techniques with bespoke image analysis tools and mathematical modelling to investigate how grain size and shape varies across wild and domesticated wheat and barley. We find that grain depth, and to a lesser extent width, are a major driver of shape change and that these are still relatively plastic traits in modern bread wheat varieties. Significant changes in grain depth are also observed to be associated with differences in ploidy. Finally, we present a model that can accurately predict the wild or domesticated status of a grain from a given taxa based on the relationship between three morphometric parameters (length, width and depth) and suggest its general applicability to both archaeological identification studies and breeding programmes.

  abstract = {Wheat is one of~the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations. In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography ({$\mu$}CT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in {$\mu$}CT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress. Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species.},

The control of cell position and division act in concert to dictate multicellular organization in tissues and organs. How these processes shape global order and molecular movement across organs is an outstanding problem in biology. Using live 3D imaging and computational analyses, we extracted networks capturing cellular connectivity dynamics across the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM) and topologically analyzed the local and global properties of cellular architecture. Locally generated cell division rules lead to the emergence of global tissue-scale organization of the SAM, facilitating robust global communication. Cells that lie upon more shorter paths have an increased propensity to divide, with division plane placement acting to limit the number of shortest paths their daughter cells lie upon. Cell shape heterogeneity and global cellular organization requires KATANIN, providing a multiscale link between cell geometry, mechanical cell-cell interactions, and global tissue order.},

The vascular system of tall trees that distributes the products of photosynthesis connects distal parts of the plant and forms one of the largest known continuous microfluidic distribution networks. In biological systems, intrinsic properties of vascular systems are known to constrain the morphological freedom of the organism. We show that the limits to leaf size can be understood by physical constraints imposed by intrinsic properties of the carbohydrate transport network.

HU value and seed dry weight showed a linear relationship in the varieties studied. This relationship was confirmed subsequently using seven other varieties.

Statistical hy- pothesis testing, in which the null hypothesis about the properties of a population is almost always known a priori to be false, is contrasted with scientific hypothesis testing, which examines a credible null hypothesis about phenomena in nature. More meaningful alternatives are briefly outlined, including estimation and con- fidence intewals for determining the importance of factors, decision theory for guiding actions in the face of uncertain\$, and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and other statistical practices.},

Membrane receptors, transporters, and enzymes communicate with intracellular processes through protein-protein interactions. Using a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screen that covers a test-space of 6.4 \texttimes{} 10(6) pairs, we identified 12,102 membrane/signaling protein interactions from Arabidopsis. Besides confirmation of expected interactions such as heterotrimeric G protein subunit interactions and aquaporin oligomerization, {$>$}99\% of the interactions were previously unknown. Interactions were confirmed at a rate of 32\% in orthogonal in planta split-green flourescent protein interaction assays, which was statistically indistinguishable from the confirmation rate for known interactions collected from literature (38\%). Regulatory associations in membrane protein trafficking, turnover, and phosphorylation include regulation of potassium channel activity through abscisic acid signaling, transporter activity by a WNK kinase, and a brassinolide receptor kinase by trafficking-related proteins. These examples underscore the utility of the membrane/signaling protein interaction network for gene discovery and hypothesis generation in plants and other organisms.},

  abstract = {Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a molecular pattern for the recognition of potential pathogens in the innate immune systems of both plants and animals. In plants, chitin oligosaccharides have been known to induce various defense responses in a wide range of plant cells including both monocots and dicots. To clarify the molecular machinery involved in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor, a high-affinity binding protein for this elicitor was isolated from the plasma membrane of suspension-cultured rice cells. Characterization of the purified protein, CEBiP, as well as the cloning of the corresponding gene revealed that CEBiP is actually a glycoprotein consisting of 328 amino acid residues and glycan chains. CEBiP was predicted to have a short membrane spanning domain at the C terminus. Knockdown of CEBiP gene by RNA interference resulted in the suppression of the elicitor-induced oxidative burst as well as the gene responses, showing that CEBiP plays a key role in the perception and transduction of chitin oligosaccharide elicitor in the rice cells. Structural analysis of CEBiP also indicated the presence of two LysM motifs in the extracellular portion of CEBiP. As the LysM motif has been known to exist in the putative Nod-factor receptor kinases involved in the symbiotic signaling between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria, the result indicates the involvement of partially homologous plasma membrane proteins both in defense and symbiotic signaling in plant cells.},

  abstract = {The spatial gradient of signaling molecules is pivotal for establishing developmental patterns of multicellular organisms. It has long been proposed that these gradients could arise from the pure diffusion process of signaling molecules between cells, but whether this simplest mechanism establishes the formation of the tissue-scale gradient remains unclear. Plasmodesmata are unique channel structures in plants that connect neighboring cells for molecular transport. In this study, we measured cellular- and tissue-scale kinetics of molecular transport through plasmodesmata in Arabidopsis thaliana developing leaf primordia by fluorescence recovery assays. These trans-scale measurements revealed biophysical properties of diffusive molecular transport through plasmodesmata and revealed that the tissue-scale diffusivity, but not the cellular-scale diffusivity, is spatially different along the leaf proximal-to-distal axis. We found that the gradient in cell size along the developmental axis underlies this spatially different tissue-scale diffusivity. We then asked how this diffusion-based framework functions in establishing a signaling gradient of endogenous molecules. ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3) is a transcriptional co-activator, and as we have shown here, it forms a long-range signaling gradient along the leaf proximal-to-distal axis to determine a cell-proliferation domain. By genetically engineering AN3 mobility, we assessed each contribution of cell-to-cell movement and tissue growth to the distribution of the AN3 gradient. We constructed a diffusion-based theoretical model using these quantitative data to analyze the AN3 gradient formation and demonstrated that it could be achieved solely by the diffusive molecular transport in a growing tissue. Our results indicate that the spatially different tissue-scale diffusivity is a core mechanism for AN3 gradient formation. This provides evidence that the pure diffusion process establishes the formation of the long-range signaling gradient in leaf development.},

From 12 hpi, VRCs in primary infected cells were associated with cortical endoplasmic reticulum, and at 14 hpi, exhibited high intracellular mobility ({$\approx$}160 nm/sec); mobility was slowed between 14 and 16 hpi ({$\approx$}40 nm/sec), and by 18 hpi, VRCs were stationary, adjacent to plasmodesmata. VRCs traversed the plasmodesmata between 18 and 20 hpi. The process of formation and movement of VRCs was repeated in adjacent cells in 3\textendash{}4 h vs. 20 h from primary infected cells. The rapid intracellular movement of the VRCs and the spread to adjacent cells was blocked by inhibitors of filamentous actin and myosin, but not by inhibitors of microtubules.

  abstract = {We present an efficient method to solve the narrow capture and narrow escape problems for the sphere. The narrow capture problem models the equilibrium behavior of a Brownian particle in the exterior of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small absorbing patches. The narrow escape problem is the dual problem: it models the behavior of a Brownian particle confined to the interior of a sphere whose surface is reflective, except for a collection of small patches through which it can escape. Mathematically, these give rise to mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary value problems of the Poisson equation. They are numerically challenging for two main reasons: (1) the solutions are non-smooth at Dirichlet-Neumann interfaces, and (2) they involve adaptive mesh refinement and the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear systems when the number of small patches is large. By using the Neumann Green's functions for the sphere, we recast each boundary value problem as a system of first-kind integral equations on the collection of patches. A block-diagonal preconditioner together with a multiple scattering formalism leads to a well-conditioned system of second-kind integral equations and a very efficient approach to discretization. This system is solved iteratively using GMRES. We develop a hierarchical, fast multipole method-like algorithm to accelerate each matrix-vector product. Our method is insensitive to the patch size, and the total cost scales with the number N of patches as O(Nlog⁡N), after a precomputation whose cost depends only on the patch size and not on the number or arrangement of patches. We demonstrate the method with several numerical examples, and are able to achieve highly accurate solutions with 100000 patches in one hour on a 60-core workstation. For that case, adaptive discretization of each patch would lead to a dense linear system with about 360 million degrees of freedom. Our preconditioned system uses only 13.6 million ``compressed'' degrees of freedom and a few dozen GMRES iterations.},

HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of {$\sim$}64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method.

  abstract = {Positional information is crucial for the determination of plant cell fates, and it is established based on coordinated cell-to-cell communication, which in turn is essential for plant growth and development. Plants have evolved a unique communication pathway, with tiny channels called plasmodesmata (PD) spanning the cell wall. PD interconnect most cells in the plant and generate a cytoplasmic continuum, to mediate short- and long-distance trafficking of various molecules. Cell-to-cell communication through PD plays a role in transmitting positional signals, however, the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated trafficking are still largely unknown. The induction and maintenance of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) depends on PDmediated cell-to-cell communication, hence, it is an optimal model for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication and its function in specifying cell fates. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication in the SAM, and discuss mechanisms underlying molecular trafficking through PD and its role in plant development.},

One specialized mechanism that plants have evolved involves transport through plasmodesmata (PD), but when and how transport of molecules via PD is regulated among individual cells remains largely unknown, particularly at the single-cell level. Here, we developed a tool for quantitatively analyzing cell-to-cell transport via PD at a single-cell level using protonemata of Physcomitrella patens and a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, Dendra2. In the filamentous protonemal tissues, one-dimensional intercellular communication can be observed easily. Using this system, we found that Dendra2 was directionally transported toward the apex of the growing protonemata. However, this directional transport could be eliminated by incubation in the dark or treatment with a metabolic inhibitor. Thus, we propose that directional transport of macromolecules can occur via PD in moss protonemata, and may be affected by the photosynthetic and metabolic activity of cells.},

It is central to a number of areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, and statistical data analysis; many of the problems arising in these applications can involve several hundred or several thousand dimensions. We consider the nearest-neighbor problem for d-dimensional Euclidean space: we wish to pre-process a database of n points so that given a query point, one can efficiently determine its nearest neighbors in the database. There is a large literature on algorithms for this problem, in both the exact and approximate cases. The more sophisticated algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in n at the expense of an exponential dependence on the dimension d; indeed, even the average-case analysis of heuristics such as k-d trees reveals an exponential dependence on d in the query time. In this work, we develop a new approach to the nearestneighbor problem, based on a method for combining randomly chosen one-dimensional projedions of the underlying point set. From this, we obtain the following two results. (i) An algorithm for finding e-approximate nearest neighbors with a query time of O((d log\^2 d)(d + log n)). (ii) An eps-approximate nearest-neighbor algorithm with near-linear storage and a query time that improves asymptotically on linear search in all dimensions.},

  abstract = {To quantify the diffusion constant of small molecules in the plant cell wall, fluorescence from carboxyfluorescein (CF) in the intact roots of Arabidopsis thaliana was recorded. Roots were immersed in a solution of the fluorescent dye and viewed through a confocal fluorescence microscope. These roots are sufficiently transparent that much of the apoplast can be imaged. The diffusion coefficient, D(cw), of CF in the cell wall was probed using two protocols: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss following perfusion with dye-free solution. Diffusion coefficients were obtained from the kinetics of the fluorescent transients and modelling apoplast geometry. Apoplastic diffusion constants varied spatially in the root. In the elongation zone and mature cortex, D(cw)=(3.2+/-1.4)x10(-11) m(2) s(-1), whereas in mature epidermis, D(cw)=(2.5+/-0.7)x10(-12) m(2) s(-1), at least an order of magnitude lower. Relative to the diffusion coefficient of CF in water, these represent reductions by approximately 1/15 and 1/195, respectively. The low value for mature epidermis is correlated with a suberin-like permeability barrier that was detected with either autofluorescence or berberine staining. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the permeability of plant cell walls to small organic acids-a class of compounds that includes auxin and other plant hormones. These measurements constrain models of solute transport, and are important for quantitative models of hormone signalling during plant growth and development.},

Our values of D agree, where they overlap, with recently published data which, however, were measured mostly at low temperature and over rather narrow ranges of temperature.The results are discussed in several ways. The Stokes\textendash{}Einstein relation is found to be obeyed in the slipping boundary limit. The cubic cell model of Houghton accounts satisfactorily for the measured D values, particularly at higher temperatures. A simple test of a hard-sphere model is found to give poor agreement at lower temperatures but a modified hard-sphere theory seems to be more satisfactory. The activation analysis at constant density shows that water behaves very differently from non-associated liquids. It also suggests that an increase in both temperature and pressure leads to an increase in the fraction of free unbonded water molecules.A free-volume analysis has led to a modified Arrhenius equation which involves pressure-dependent terms. This semi-empirical equation describes the results within experimental error and predicts a glass temperature at 115 K which is in reasonable agreement with the values obtained by other methods.},

Real-time PCR and RNA-Seq approaches were used to identify and characterize mobile transcripts from tomato and Arabidopsis hosts into C. pentagona. Tomato transcripts of Gibberellic Acid Insensitive (SlGAI) and Cathepsin D Proteinase Inhibitor (SlPI) differed significantly in the rate of uptake into the parasite, but were then distributed over the length of the parasite shoot. When parasite shoots were detached from the hosts, the SlPI transcript concentrations in the parasite showed the greatest decrease within the first 8 h. Arabidopsis transcripts also varied in mobility into the parasite, and assay of specific regions of a Salt-inducible Zinc Finger Protein (AtSZF1) transcript revealed distinct patterns of abundance in the parasite. The uptake and distribution of host mRNAs into C. pentagona appears to vary among mRNAs, and perhaps even with the region of the mRNA under investigation. We propose that mRNAs traffic into the parasite via multiple routes, or that other mechanisms for selective uptake and mobility exist between host and parasite.},

However, although these pathogens have acquired the capacity to breach the plasmodesmal trafficking pathway, plants are unlikely to relinquish control over a structure essential for their survival so easily. In this review, we examine evidence that suggests plasmodesmata play an active role in plant immunity against viral, fungal and bacterial pathogens. We discuss how these pathogens differ in their lifestyles and infection modes, and present the defense strategies that plants have adopted to prevent the intercellular spread of an infection. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because plant cells are encased in rigid cell walls, direct cell-to-cell exchange of cytoplasmic content is only possible through plasmodesmata (PD), membrane-lined nanotubes that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. PD are highly dynamic communication channels that can undergo various structural and functional modifications. Recent findings in the field suggest that defense signaling pathways are tightly linked to the regulation of PD, and the restriction of PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication is an essential innate immune response to microbial pathogens. Moreover, several plasma membrane-bound signaling components, including receptor-like kinases that are known to have non-cell autonomous function or pathogen perception at the cell periphery, are found to also partition to PD. These findings hint at the novel role of PD as a signaling hub for both symplasmic and cross-membrane pathways.},

However, how specific signaling pathways integrate PD-mediated cell-to-cell communication is not well understood. Here, we present experimental evidence showing that the Arabidopsis thaliana plasmodesmata-located protein 5 (PDLP5; also known as HOPW1-1-INDUCED GENE1) mediates crosstalk between PD regulation and salicylic acid\textendash{}dependent defense responses. PDLP5 was found to localize at the central region of PD channels and associate with PD pit fields, acting as an inhibitor to PD trafficking, potentially through its capacity to modulate PD callose deposition. As a regulator of PD, PDLP5 was also essential for conferring enhanced innate immunity against bacterial pathogens in a salicylic acid\textendash{}dependent manner. Based on these findings, a model is proposed illustrating that the regulation of PD closure mediated by PDLP5 constitutes a crucial part of coordinated control of cell-to-cell communication and defense signaling.},

By characterising the chloroplast diversity in each wheat species in the evolutionary series, the impact on diversity of major evolutionary events such as domestication and polyploidyisation was assessed. We detected bottlenecks associated with domestication, polyploidisation and selection, yet these constrictions were partially offset by mutations in the chloroplast SSR loci that generated new alleles. The discrete cpSSR alleles and haplotypes observed in T. urartu and Aegilops tauschii, combined with other species specific polymorphisms, provide very strong evidence that concur with current opinion that neither species was the maternal and thus cytoplasmic donor for polyploid wheats. Synthetic hexaploid wheats possessed the same chloroplast haplotypes as their tetraploid progenitors demonstrating how the novel synthetic wheat lines have captured chloroplast diversity from the maternal parents, the chloroplast is maternally inherited and novel alleles are not created by genomic rearrangements triggered by the polyploidisation event.},

Transport through Pd mediates many processes in plants, among them information transfer for coordination of development, movement of photosynthesis products from mature to developing and storage tissues, responses to pathogen infection and systemic gene silencing. A basic structure of simple primary Pd consists of two coaxial membrane tubes. The inner membrane along the Pd axis, termed the desmotubule, is continuous with and connects the ER of the bordering cells; the outer coaxial membrane is continuous with and connects plasma membranes of adjacent cells. Between the membranes is a sleeve that interconnects the cytoplasm of the neighboring cells. Within the cytoplasmic sleeve are particles whose identity is still unknown, but have been interpreted to be cytoskeletal proteins.},

A major challenge to understanding disease and defense responses is discriminating between transcriptional reprogramming associated with microbial-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity (MTI) and that orchestrated by effectors. A high-resolution time course of genome-wide expression changes following challenge with Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and the nonpathogenic mutant strain DC3000hrpA- allowed us to establish causal links between the activities of pathogen effectors and suppression of MTI and infer with high confidence a range of processes specifically targeted by effectors. Analysis of this information-rich data set with a range of computational tools provided insights into the earliest transcriptional events triggered by effector delivery, regulatory mechanisms recruited, and biological processes targeted. We show that the majority of genes contributing to disease or defense are induced within 6 h postinfection, significantly before pathogen multiplication. Suppression of chloroplast-associated genes is a rapid MAMP-triggered defense response, and suppression of genes involved in chromatin assembly and induction of ubiquitin-related genes coincide with pathogen-induced abscisic acid accumulation. Specific combinations of promoter motifs are engaged in fine-tuning the MTI response and active transcriptional suppression at specific promoter configurations by P. syringae.},

Viral ectopic expression of FT induced flowering in the short-day N. tabacum Maryland Mammoth tobacco under long-day conditions. Recombinant Potato virus X bearing FT RNA spread and established systemic infection more quickly than the parental virus.

  abstract = {Plant cells are directly connected by plasmodesmata that form channels through the cell wall and enable the intercellular movement of cytosolic solutes, membrane lipids and signalling molecules. Transport through plasmodesmata is regulated not only by a fixed size-exclusion limit, but also by physiological and pathological adaptation. To understand plant cell communication, carbon allocation and pathogen attack, the capacities for a specific molecule to pass a specific cell-wall interface is an essential parameter. So far, the degree of cell coupling was derived from frequency and diameter of plasmodesmata in relevant tissues as assessed by electron microscopy of fixed material. However, plasmodesmata functionality and capacity can only be determined in live material, not from electron microscopy, which is static and prone to fixation artefacts. Plasmodesmata functionality was a few times assessed using fluorescent tracers with diffusion properties similar to cytosolic solutes. Here, we used three-dimensional photoactivation microscopy to quantify plasmodesmata-mediated cell-wall permeability between living Cucurbita maxima leaf mesophyll cells with caged fluorescein as tracer. For the first time, all necessary functional and anatomical data were gathered for each individual cell from three-dimensional time series. This approach utilized a confocal microscope equipped with resonant scanner, which provides the high acquisition speed necessary to record optical sections of whole cells and offers time resolution high enough to follow the kinetics of photoactivation. The results were compared to two-dimensional measurements, which are shown to give a good estimate of cell coupling adequate for homogenous tissues. The two-dimensional approach is limited whenever tissues interfaces are studied that couple different cell types with diverse cell geometries.},

  abstract = {Seed size is one of the most important yield traits in plants. In angiosperms, a mature seed consists of the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat, which develop from the zygote, the fertilized central cell and the maternal integuments, respectively. Seed size is therefore coordinately controlled by the growth of maternal and zygotic tissues. Several signaling pathways that determine seed size by influencing the endosperm and/or maternal tissue growth have been identified, including the IKU pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, G-protein signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, phytohormones and transcriptional regulatory factors. The functions of several seed size regulators are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice; therefore it is promising to convert basic research on seed size into practical applications in crops. In this review, we summarize recent research progress on seed size control, with particular emphasis on the genetic and molecular mechanisms of several newly identified regulators of seed size in Arabidopsis and rice.},

  abstract = {Higher temperatures caused by future climate change will bring more frequent heat stress events and pose an increasing risk to global wheat production. Crop models have been widely used to simulate future crop productivity but are rarely tested with observed heat stress experimental datasets. Four wheat models (DSSAT-CERES-Wheat, DSSAT-Nwheat, APSIM-Wheat, and WheatGrow) were evaluated with 4~years of environment-controlled phytotron experimental datasets with two wheat cultivars under heat stress at anthesis and grain filling stages. Heat stress at anthesis reduced observed grain numbers per unit area and individual grain size, while heat stress during grain filling mainly decreased the size of the individual grains. The observed impact of heat stress on grain filling duration, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, and grain protein concentration (GPC) varied depending on cultivar and accumulated heat stress. For every unit increase of heat degree days (HDD, degree days over 30~\textdegree{}C), grain filling duration was reduced by 0.30\textendash{}0.60\%, total aboveground biomass was reduced by 0.37\textendash{}0.43\%, and grain yield was reduced by 1.0\textendash{}1.6\%, but GPC was increased by 0.50\% for cv Yangmai16 and 0.80\% for cv Xumai30. The tested crop simulation models could reproduce some of the observed reductions in grain filling duration, final total aboveground biomass, and grain yield, as well as the observed increase in GPC due to heat stress. Most of the crop models tended to reproduce heat stress impacts better during grain filling than at anthesis. Some of the tested models require improvements in the response to heat stress during grain filling, but all models need improvements in simulating heat stress effects on grain set during anthesis. The observed significant genetic variability in the response of wheat to heat stress needs to be considered through cultivar parameters in future simulation studies.},

Pseudomonas syringae secretes c. 30 effectors, some of which have been shown to inhibit plant immunity triggered upon perception of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). One of these is HopM1, which impairs late immune responses through targeting the vesicle trafficking-related AtMIN7 for degradation. Here, we report that in planta expressed HopM1 suppresses two early PAMP-triggered responses, the oxidative burst and stomatal immunity, both of which seem to require proteasomal function but are independent of AtMIN7. Notably, a 14-3-3 protein, GRF8/AtMIN10, was found previously to be a target of HopM1 in vivo, and expression of HopM1 mimics the effect of chemically and genetically disrupting 14-3-3 function. Our data further show that the function of 14-3-3 proteins is required for PAMP-triggered oxidative burst and stomatal immunity, and chemical-mediated disruption of the 14-3-3 interactions with their client proteins restores virulence of a HopM1-deficient P. syringae mutant, providing a link between HopM1 and the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in plant immunity. Taken together, these results unveil the impact of HopM1 on the PAMP-triggered oxidative burst and stomatal immunity in an AtMIN7-independent manner, most likely acting at the function of (a) 14-3-3 protein(s).},

Recent analyses of Arabidopsis and rice revealed FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein as a systemic florigenic signal. However, whether the FT RNA also participates in systemic floral regulation remains controversial. By using Arabidopsis cleft-grafting experiments, we showed that the RNA of Arabidopsis FT undergoes long-distance movement from the stock to the scion apex in both FT transformants and non-transformants. In addition, the sequences of FT RNA are sufficient to target a cell-autonomous RNA for long-distance movement. Therefore, FT RNA is a bona fide non-cell autonomous RNA.

However, the timing and synchrony of male and female flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum. METHODS From the onset of flowering until the end of anthesis, the anther and stigma activity of each floret was assessed on the first five developing ears in potted plants grown under ambient conditions and originating from 'Paragon' or 'Spark-Rialto' backgrounds. At harvest maturity, seed presence, size and weight was recorded for each floret scored. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30 \% and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK.},

Based on a commonly used hydroponic culture system, we found that variations in growth conditions have a major impact on the plant's overall capacity to deposit callose. This environmental variability correlated with levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production.

These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling system, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. We first improved this system by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified system allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP system with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.},

Past studies have revealed the basic structure of PD, some of the transport mechanisms for molecules through PD, and a variety of physiological processes in which they function. Recently, with the help of newly developed technologies, several exciting new features of PD have been revealed. New PD structures were observed during early formation of PD and between phloem sieve elements and phloem pole pericycle cells in roots. Both observations challenge our current understanding of PD structure and function. Research into novel physiological responses, which are regulated by PD, indicates that we have not yet fully explored the potential contribution of PD to overall plant function. In this Viewpoint article, we summarize some of the recent advances in understanding the structure and function of PD and propose the challenges ahead for the community.},

This metabolic sequence converts the primary metabolites PEP and erythrose-4-P to chorismate, the last common precursor for the three aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp and for p-amino and p-hydroxy benzoate (Fig. 1). The shikimate pathway is found in bacteria, fungi, and plants. In monogastric animals, Phe and Trp are essential amino acids that have to come with the diet and Tyr is directly derived from Phe. Since bacteria use in excess of 90\% of their metabolic energy for protein biosynthesis, for most prokaryotes, the three aromatic amino acids represent nearly the entire output of aromatic biosynthesis, and reg- ulatory mechanisms for shikimate pathway activity are triggered by the intracellular concentrations of Phe, Tyr, and Trp. This is not so in higher plants, in which the aromatic amino acids are the precursors for a large variety of secondary metabolites with aromatic ring structures that often make up a substantial amount of the total dry weight of a plant. Among the many aromatic secondary metabo- lites are flavonoids, many phytoalexins, indole acetate, alkaloids such as morphine, UV light protectants, and, most important, lignin},

Recent research has shown this complex suite of processes can now be observed in a natural environment (i.e. soil) through the use of X-ray micro Computed Tomography ({$\mu$}CT), which allows non-destructive analysis of plant root systems. Due to their similar X-ray attenuation coefficients and densities, the roots of different plants appear as similar greyscale intensity values in {$\mu$}CT image data. Unless they are manually and carefully traced, it has previously not been possible to automatically label and separate different root systems grown in the same soil environment. We present a technique, based on a visual tracking approach, which exploits knowledge of the shape of root cross-sections to automatically recover 3D descriptions of multiple, interacting root architectures growing in soil from X-ray {$\mu$}CT data. The method was evaluated on both simulated root data and real images of two interacting winter wheat Cordiale (Triticumaestivum L.) plants grown in a single soil column, demonstrating that it is possible to automatically segment different root systems from within the same soil sample. This work supports the automatic exploration of supportive and competitive foraging behaviour of plant root systems in natural soil environments. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Maize (Zea mays) is a staple cereal crop cultivated all over the world but that is threatened by various insects. Feeding of the lepidopteran insect Mythimna separata triggers defence signalling and increases anti-herbivore benzoxazinoids (Bxs) in the insect-damaged maize leaves. However, the herbivory-elicited within-leaf and leaf-to-leaf systemic signalling in maize remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that simulated M. separata herbivory and mechanical wounding elicited increased levels of jasmonic acid (JA), JA\textendash{}Ile (JA\textendash{}isoleucine conjugate) and Bxs in the damaged areas and in specific systemic regions within a leaf. Importantly, increased contents of Bxs were detected in a systemic leaf, and consistently, this leaf exhibited increased defence against M. separata. Increased JA/JA\textendash{}Ile and altered transcriptome, including Bx biosynthesis genes, were detected in systemic leaves after wounding or simulated herbivory treatments, although only simulated herbivory induced increase of the contents of Bxs systemically. Promoter and co-expression analysis revealed that transcription factors bHLH57 and WRKY34 may regulate Bx biosynthesis genes in systemic leaves. Moreover, leaf ablation experiment indicated that the systemic signal rapidly exited the local leaves within 30 min after elicitation. This study provides new insight into the temporal and spatial regulation of defence responses of maize against lepidopteran insects.This article is part of the theme issue `Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management'.},

Environmental conditions such as moisture deficit and high temperatures during the growing period affect the grain yield and grain characteristics of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The aim of this study was to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain yield and grain quality traits using a Drysdale/Gladius bread wheat mapping population grown under a range of environmental conditions in Australia and Mexico. In general, yield and grain quality were reduced in environments exposed to drought and/or heat stress. Despite large effects of known photoperiod-sensitivity loci (Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1) on crop development, grain yield and grain quality traits, it was possible to detect QTL elsewhere in the genome. Some of these QTL were detected consistently across environments. A locus on chromosome 6A (TaGW2) that is known to be associated with grain development was associated with grain width, thickness and roundness. The grain hardness (Ha) locus on chromosome 5D was associated with particle size index and flour extraction and a region on chromosome 3B was associated with grain width, thickness, thousand grain weight and yield. The genetic control of grain length appeared to be largely independent of the genetic control of the other grain dimensions. As expected, effects on grain yield were detected at loci that also affected yield components. Some QTL displayed QTL-by-environment interactions, with some having effects only in environments subject to water limitation and/or heat stress.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {A cell membrane can be considered a liquid-phase plane in which lipids and proteins theoretically are free to diffuse. Numerous reports, however, describe retarded diffusion of membrane proteins in animal cells. This anomalous diffusion results from a combination of structuring factors including protein\textendash{}protein interactions, cytoskeleton corralling, and lipid organization into microdomains. In plant cells, plasma-membrane (PM) proteins have been described as relatively immobile, but the control mechanisms that structure the PM have not been studied. Here, we use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to estimate mobility of a set of minimal PM proteins. These proteins consist only of a PM-anchoring domain fused to a fluorescent protein, but their mobilities remained limited, as is the case for many full-length proteins. Neither the cytoskeleton nor membrane microdomain structure was involved in constraining the diffusion of these proteins. The cell wall, however, was shown to have a crucial role in immobilizing PM proteins. In addition, by single-molecule fluorescence imaging we confirmed that the pattern of cellulose deposition in the cell wall affects the trajectory and speed of PM protein diffusion. Regulation of PM protein dynamics by the plant cell wall can be interpreted as a mechanism for regulating protein interactions in processes such as trafficking and signal transduction.},

Using optimization procedures this framework allows us to explore the biochemical determinants of calcium decoding. We explore simple toy models and general binding kinetics approaches to demonstrate the utility and limitations of the proposed framework.

These might depend upon electrical or chemical signals or the mass transfer of molecules between adjacent cells. Molecular communication occurs either via an extra-cellular pathway or through physical structures, called plasmodesmata, that connect the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. Plasmodesmata bridge the rigid physical barrier presented by the cell wall to extend the symplasm from single cells to tissue domains that have functional importance for tissue growth, development, and defense. Although recent years have seen advances in our knowledge of the physical nature of PD, the trafficked molecules, and of the wider processes they affect, our knowledge of PD structure and function is still relatively rudimentary.

Here, we show that a plant virus-encoded protein re-localizes from the plasma membrane to chloroplasts upon triggering plant defence, interfering with the chloroplast-dependent activation of anti-viral salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Strikingly, we have found that plant pathogens from different kingdoms seem to have convergently evolved to target chloroplasts and impair SA-dependent defences following an association with membranes, which is based on the co-existence of two subcellular targeting signals, an N-myristoylation site and a chloroplast transit peptide. This pattern is also present in plant proteins, at least one of which conversely activates SA defences from the chloroplast. Taken together, our results suggest that a pathway linking plasma membrane to chloroplasts and activating defence exists in plants, and that such pathway has been co-opted by plant pathogens during host-pathogen co-evolution to promote virulence through suppression of SA responses.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Chito-oligosaccharides [{$\beta$}-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine oligomers, (GlcNAc)n] are the only glycosidic structures from fungal walls that have been well-demonstrated to function as MAMPs in plants. Perception of (GlcNAc)4\textendash{}8 by Arabidopsis involves CERK1, LYK4 and LYK5, three of the eight members of the LysM PRR family. We found that a glucan-enriched wall fraction from the pathogenic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina which was devoid of GlcNAc activated immune responses in Arabidopsis wild-type plants but not in the cerk1 mutant. Using this differential response, we identified the non-branched 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-(Glc) hexasaccharide as a major fungal MAMP. Recognition of 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-(Glc)6 was impaired in cerk1 but not in mutants defective in either each of the LysM PRR family members or in the PRR-co-receptor BAK1. Transcriptomic analyses of Arabidopsis plants treated with 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-(Glc)6 further demonstrated that this fungal MAMP triggers the expression of immunity-associated genes. In silico docking analyses with molecular mechanics and solvation energy calculations corroborated that CERK1 can bind 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-(Glc)6 at effective concentrations similar to those of (GlcNAc)4. These data support that plants, like animals, have selected as MAMPs the linear 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-glucans present in the walls of fungi and oomycetes. Our data also suggest that CERK1 functions as an immune co-receptor for linear 1,3-{$\beta$}-d-glucans in a similar way to its proposed function in the recognition of fungal chito-oligosaccharides and bacterial peptidoglycan MAMPs.},

  abstract = {Roots are vital to plants for soil exploration and uptake of water and nutrients. Root performance is critical for growth and yield of plants, in particular when resources are limited. Since roots develop in strong interaction with the soil matrix, tools are required that can visualize and quantify root growth in opaque soil at best in 3D. Two modalities that are suited for such investigations are X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Due to the different physical principles they are based on, these modalities have their specific potentials and challenges for root phenotyping. We compared the two methods by imaging the same root systems grown in 3 different pot sizes with inner diameters of 34~mm, 56~mm or 81~mm. Both methods successfully visualized roots of two weeks old bean plants in all three pot sizes. Similar root images and almost the same root length were obtained for roots grown in the small pot, while more root details showed up in the CT images compared to MRI. For the medium sized pot, MRI showed more roots and higher root lengths whereas at some spots thin roots were only found by CT and the high water content apparently affected CT more than MRI. For the large pot, MRI detected much more roots including some laterals than CT. Both techniques performed equally well for pots with small diameters which are best suited to monitor root development of seedlings. To investigate specific root details or finely graduated root diameters of thin roots, CT was advantageous as it provided the higher spatial resolution. For larger pot diameters, MRI delivered higher fractions of the root systems than CT, most likely because of the strong root-to-soil contrast achievable by MRI. Since complementary information can be gathered with CT and MRI, a combination of the two modalities could open a whole range of additional possibilities like analysis of root system traits in different soil structures or under varying soil moisture.},

For cells in standard growth medium the diffusion coefficients for cytosolic proteins (27 and 582\,kDa) and 12-transmembrane helix membrane proteins are similar to those in Escherichia coli. The translational diffusion of GFP in L. lactis drops by two orders of magnitude when the medium osmolality is increased by {$\sim$}\,1.9 Osm, and the decrease in mobility is partly reversed in the presence of osmoprotectants. We find a large spread in diffusion coefficients over the full population of cells but a smaller spread if only sister cells are compared. While in general the diffusion coefficients we measure under normal osmotic conditions in L. lactis are similar to those reported in E. coli, the decrease in translational diffusion upon osmotic challenge in L. lactis is smaller than in E. coli. An even more striking difference is that in L. lactis the GFP diffusion coefficient drops much more rapidly with volume than in E. coli. We discuss these findings in the light of differences in turgor, cell volume, crowding and cytoplasmic structure of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.},

  abstract = {Plant defence signalling response against various pathogens, including viruses, is a complex phenomenon. In resistant interaction a plant cell perceives the pathogen signal, transduces it within the cell and performs a reprogramming of the cell metabolism leading to the pathogen replication arrest. This work focuses on signalling pathways crucial for the plant defence response, i.e., the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene signal transduction pathways, in the Arabidopsis thaliana model plant. The initial signalling network topology was constructed manually by defining the representation formalism, encoding the information from public databases and literature, and composing a pathway diagram. The manually constructed network structure consists of 175 components and 387 reactions. In order to complement the network topology with possibly missing relations, a new approach to automated information extraction from biological literature was developed. This approach, named Bio3graph, allows for automated extraction of biological relations from the literature, resulting in a set of (component1, reaction, component2) triplets and composing a graph structure which can be visualised, compared to the manually constructed topology and examined by the experts. Using a plant defence response vocabulary of components and reaction types, Bio3graph was applied to a set of 9,586 relevant full text articles, resulting in 137 newly detected reactions between the components. Finally, the manually constructed topology and the new reactions were merged to form a network structure consisting of 175 components and 524 reactions. The resulting pathway diagram of plant defence signalling represents a valuable source for further computational modelling and interpretation of omics data. The developed Bio3graph approach, implemented as an executable language processing and graph visualisation workflow, is publically available at http://ropot.ijs.si/bio3graph/and can be utilised for modelling other biological systems, given that an adequate vocabulary is provided.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) control many different processes in plants. However, being toxic molecules, they are also capable of injuring cells. How this conflict is resolved in plants is largely unknown. Nonetheless, it is clear that the steady-state level of ROS in cells needs to be tightly regulated. In Arabidopsis, a network of at least 152 genes is involved in managing the level of ROS. This network is highly dynamic and redundant, and encodes ROS-scavenging and ROS-producing proteins. Although recent studies have unraveled some of the key players in the network, many questions related to its mode of regulation, its protective roles and its modulation of signaling networks that control growth, development and stress response remain unanswered.},

  abstract = {Chitin is a major component of fungal cell walls and serves as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) for the detection of various potential pathogens in innate immune systems of both plants and animals. We recently showed that chitin elicitor-binding protein (CEBiP), plasma membrane glycoprotein with LysM motifs, functions as a cell surface receptor for chitin elicitor in rice. The predicted structure of CEBiP does not contain any intracellular domains, suggesting that an additional component(s) is required for signaling through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. Here, we identified a receptor-like kinase, designated CERK1, which is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis. The KO mutants for CERK1 completely lost the ability to respond to the chitin elicitor, including MAPK activation, reactive oxygen species generation, and gene expression. Disease resistance of the KO mutant against an incompatible fungus, Alternaria brassicicola, was partly impaired. Complementation with the WT CERK1 gene showed cerk1 mutations were responsible for the mutant phenotypes. CERK1 is a plasma membrane protein containing three LysM motifs in the extracellular domain and an intracellular Ser/Thr kinase domain with autophosphorylation/myelin basic protein kinase activity, suggesting that CERK1 plays a critical role in fungal MAMP perception in plants.},

Using water spray to simulate rain, we demonstrate that jasmonic acid (JA) signaling plays a key role in early gene-expression changes, well before it leads to developmental changes in flowering and plant architecture. The JA-activated transcription factors MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 modulate transiently induced expression of 266 genes, most of which peak within 30 min, and control 52\% of genes induced {$>$}100-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis indicates that MYC2 dynamically binds {$>$}1,300 promoters and trans-activation assays show that MYC2 activates these promoters. By mining our multiomic datasets, we identified a core MYC2/MYC3/MYC4-dependent ``regulon'' of 82 genes containing many previously unknown MYC2 targets, including transcription factors bHLH19 and ERF109. bHLH19 can in turn directly activate the ORA47 promoter, indicating that MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 initiate a hierarchical network of downstream transcription factors. Finally, we also reveal that rapid water spray-induced accumulation of JA and JA-isoleucine is directly controlled by MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 through a positive amplification loop that regulates JA-biosynthesis genes.},

A number of genes were up- and down-regulated specifically at 12 h, others at 24 h while others were up- and down-regulated at both time points. Similarly, some genes were specifically induced very close to the lesion while others in more distal tissue. Clustering of expression profiles resulting from other biotic and abiotic interactions with Arabidopsis indicated a large overlap in gene expression. This study highlighted a multitude of genes induced in Arabidopsis spatially and temporally following infection with B. cinerea providing an insight into key processes of defence against this pathogen.

  abstract = {Phenotyping is a critical component of plant research. Accurate and precise trait collection, when integrated with genetic tools, can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement. However, efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support. In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (image capture~\textrightarrow{}~data storage and curation~\textrightarrow{}~trait extraction~\textrightarrow{}~machine learning/classification~\textrightarrow{}~models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. We illustrate such an end-to-end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean, with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) severity on thousands of field plots. We showcase this analytics framework by extracting IDC features from a set of\~{ }4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of IDC, and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity. The best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field. We investigated 10 different classification approaches, with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean per-class accuracy of\~{ }96\%. We construct a phenotypically meaningful `population canopy graph', connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating. We incorporated this image capture~\textrightarrow{}~image processing~\textrightarrow{}~classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated real-time evaluation of IDC scores using digital images of the canopy. We expect this high-throughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses. We further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow real-time, automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research, breeding and stress scouting applications.},

  abstract = {Grain shape and size are involved in the main components of the domestication syndrome in cereals. Wheat grain shape has been dramatically altered at each stage of the domestication of tetraploid wheat and through common wheat speciation. To elucidate the evolutionary change of wheat grain shape, principal component (PC) analysis of grain shape-related traits was first conducted using wild and cultivated tetraploid, synthetic hexaploid, and common wheat accessions. The synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were previously produced through interspecific crosses between two common wheat progenitors, tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii, and produced grains similar to those of cultivated tetraploid wheat. To identify genetic loci related to the difference in grain shape between common wheat and the synthetic wheat, the 15 traits related to grain and spikelet shape were measured in 108 F(2) individuals between Norin 61 and a synthetic wheat line, and the first three PC values for the 15 traits, PC1, PC2 and PC3, were mapped as quantitative traits in the F(2) population. In total, six QTLs, found on chromosomes 1A, 5A, 1D, 2D and 7D, showed significant LOD scores. Among them, a QTL for PC2, located on the 2DS chromosomal region near the Ppd-D1 locus, mainly contributed to the phenotypic difference in grain shape. Tg-D1, controlling tenacious glume phenotype, was located at a similar region to the 2DS QTL, which suggested that the Tg-D1 locus pleiotropically affects not only glume toughness but also spikelet and grain shape in hexaploid wheat. Therefore, it was predicted that wheat grains were rapidly improved toward a shorter and rounder phenotype accompanied with free-threshing wheat formation.},

The analysis begins by questioning a certain understanding, widespread in the literature of new surveillance technologies, of Foucaults conceptions of power and surveillance. In brief, this understanding privileges the surveillance of many by few, of us by them. We contend, instead, that Foucault stressed in diverse books and articles the nexus between power relations and practices of the care of the self. Hence, techniques of surveillance are necessarily related to practices of self-surveillance. This theoretical framework constitutes the basis for differentiating two historically distinct types of self-surveillance: the first, proper to disciplinary society, is promoted by normalizing power; the second is associated to the increasing relevance of the epidemiological concept of risk in the problematizing of health-related behaviors. Epidemiology of risk factors, medical testing and genetics are opening up a temporal gap between the diagnostic of illnesses/diseases and their subjective symptoms. This gap is equivalent to a space for individual pre-emptive action against possible illnesses/diseases.},

  abstract = {The phloem of higher plants translocates a diverse range of macromolecules including proteins, RNAs, and pathogens. This review considers the origin and destination of such macromolecules. A survey of the literature reveals that the majority of phloem-mobile macromolecules are synthesized within companion cells and enter the sieve elements through the branched plasmodesmata that connect these cells. Examples of systemic macromolecules that originate outside the companion cell are rare and are restricted to viral and subviral pathogens and putative RNA gene-silencing signals, all of which involve a relay system in which the macromolecule is amplified in each successive cell along the pathway to companion cells. Evidence is presented that xenobiotic macromolecules may enter the sieve element by a default pathway as they do not possess the necessary signals for retention in the sieve element-companion cell complex. Several sink tissues possess plasmodesmata with a high-molecular-size exclusion limit, potentially allowing the nonspecific escape of a wide range of small ({$<$}50-kDa) macromolecules from the phloem. Larger macromolecules and systemic mRNAs appear to require facilitated transport through sink plasmodesmata. The fate of phloem-mobile macromolecules is considered in relation to current models of long-distance signaling in plants.},

Mice were inoculated intrarectally with saline, ethanol or different TNBS solutions. 1\%TNBS induced clinical signs of colitis (P less than 0.01) and histological damage (P less than 0.01). Based on these results, mice were pre-treated with Citogenex or saline for 1, 2 or 3 weeks before 1\%TNBS treatment. Probiotic pre-treatment determined a reduction of clinical signs (P less than 0.05), histological alterations of colitis (P less than 0.05) and increased beneficial bacteria (P less than 0.05). This study confirms that TNBS-induced colitis in CD-1 mice is useful for studying the mechanisms involved in IBD pathogenesis, and pre-treatment with Citogenex prevents the intestinal damage induced by TNBS.},

However, previous work has been unable to determine precisely how the three dimensional (3D) complexity of leaf structure impacts upon photosynthetic activity, partly due to a lack of appropriate methods for undisturbed visualization and quantification of inner structures at an appropriate high resolution (i.e. 5-10 -m). Although there is a wide range of traditional, optical-based techniques for visualization and quantification of plant morphology and anatomy, ranging from imaging of thin sections to confocal microscopy of intact specimens, their use is usually limited by the type and size of sample material. Furthermore, analysis is often time consuming, destructive, and constrained to two dimensions (2D) (classical histology) or limited in optical depth (confocal microscopy).\textcopyright{} 2013 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) is well known for its induction of pathogenesis-related proteins and systemic acquired resistance; SA also has specific effects on plant growth and development. Here we analyzed the effect of SA on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root development. We show that exogenous SA treatment at low (below 50 \textmu{}M) and high (greater than 50 \textmu{}M) concentrations affect root meristem development in two different PR1-independent ways. Low-concentration SA promoted adventitious roots and altered architecture of the root apical meristem, whereas high-concentration SA inhibited all growth processes in the root. All exposures to exogenous SA led to changes in auxin synthesis and transport. A wide range of SA treatment concentrations activated auxin synthesis, but the effect of SA on auxin transport was dose dependent. Mathematical modeling of auxin synthesis and transport predicted auxin accumulation or depletion in the root tip following low- or high-concentration SA treatments, respectively. SA-induced auxin accumulation led to the formation of more layers of columella initials, an additional cortical cell layer (middle cortex), and extra files of epidermis, cortex, and endodermis cells. Suppression of SHORT ROOT and activation of CYCLIN D6;1 mediated the changes in radial architecture of the root. We propose that low-concentration SA plays an important role in shaping root meristem structure and root system architecture.},

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with outcomes inferior to those of other breast cancer subtypes. No targeted therapies are currently approved for TNBC, and newer treatment approaches are critically needed. It is increasingly recognized that TNBC is a heterogeneous disease, and the role of androgen signaling in a subset of TNBC is emerging. Although the degree of androgen receptor (AR) expression in TNBC varies widely depending on the assay methodology, cutoff for positivity, and patient population, existing evidence suggests an association between a higher level of AR expression and improved outcomes. Despite lower pathologic complete response (pCR) rates with neoadjuvant therapy, patients with AR-dependent TNBCs have a better prognosis than those with TNBCs that are not AR-dependent. Furthermore, gene expression profiling has been used to identify a luminal androgen receptor subtype of TNBC that is dependent on AR signaling. Early clinical studies investigating agents targeting AR in advanced TNBC have produced promising results. We review herein the literature on the biology of AR in breast cancer and its prognostic and predictive role in TNBC, and we describe the results of early clinical trials with antiandrogens in this population. We also present our vision of the future development of newer therapeutic strategies in AR-dependent.},

  abstract = {Domestication of plants and animals is the major factor underlying human civilization and is a gigantic evolutionary experiment of adaptation and speciation, generating incipient species. Wheat is one of the most important grain crops in the world, and consists mainly of two types: the hexaploid bread wheat Triticum aestivum accounting for about 95\% of world wheat production, and the tetraploid durum wheat T. durum accounting for the other 5\%. In this review, we summarize and discuss research on wheat domestication, mainly focusing on recent findings in genetics and genomics studies. T. aestivum originated from a cross between domesticated emmer wheat T. dicoccum and the goat grass Aegilops tauschii , most probably in the south and west of the Caspian Sea about 9,000 years ago. Wild emmer wheat has the same genome formula as durum wheat and has contributed two genomes to bread wheat, and is central to wheat domestication. Domestication has genetically not only transformed the brittle rachis, tenacious glume and non-free threshability, but also modified yield and yield components in wheat. Wheat domestication involves a limited number of chromosome regions, or domestication syndrome factors, though many relevant quantitative trait loci have been detected. On completion of the genome sequencing of diploid wild wheat T. urartu or Ae. tauschii domestication syndrome factors and other relevant genes could be isolated, and effects of wheat domestication could be determined. The achievements of domestication genetics and robust research programs in Triticeae genomics are of greatly help in conservation and exploitation of wheat germplasm and genetic improvement of wheat cultivars.},

Two issues that were central to the cultural transition from foraging to food production are poorly understood. They are the dates at which human groups began to routinely exploit wild varieties of wheat and barley, and when foragers first utilized technologies to pound and grind the hard, fibrous seeds of these and other plants to turn them into easily digestible foodstuffs. Here we report the earliest direct evidence for human processing of grass seeds, including barley and possibly wheat, in the form of starch grains recovered from a ground stone artefact from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Ohalo II in Israel. Associated evidence for an oven-like hearth was also found at this site, suggesting that dough made from grain flour was baked. Our data indicate that routine processing of a selected group of wild cereals, combined with effective methods of cooking ground seeds, were practiced at least 12,000 years before their domestication in southwest Asia.},

Results: Of the 60 PD patients without dementia, 2 cases(3.3\%) were found cognitive impairment by MMSE, while 23 cases(38. 3\%) were found cognitive impairment by LOTCA, and which were mostly found in visuo-motor organization and thinking operation. The univariate analysis found that age, onset age, depression, dyskinetic severity and type were related with cognitive impairment. Multiplicity Logistic regression analysis showed that age, depression and posture-unsteadiness and gaitirregularity (PICD) type of dyskinesia were risk factors of cognitive impairment. Conclusions: LOTCA is suitable to assess the cognitive impairment in PD patients without dementia. Age, depression and PIGD type of dyskinesia may be the risk factors of influence on cognitive function in PD patients without dementia.},

In order to determine the possible structural and func- tional effects of callose, its deposition was inhibited through incuba- tion of the plant tissue with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DDG) for 1 h prior to fixation in 2.5\% glutaraldehyde. The inhibition of callose forma- tion was monitored through aniline blue-induced fluorescence of cal- lose. The neck region of the plasmodesmata from Allium cepa L. roots treated with DDG exhibited a funnel-shaped configuration. This is in contrast to the plasmodesmata from tissue not incubated with DDG, which exhibited constricted necks similar to those previ- ously reported. Both initial dissection and glutaraldehyde fixation induced neck constriction in plasmodesmata, however, dissection of tissue increased the frequency of constrictions. The inhibition of cap lose formation by chemical means showed that the neck constrictions and raised collars in this area are artefacts due to physical wounding and glutaraldehyde fixation. The external electron-dense material observed when tannic acid is included in the primary fixative appears to be unrelated to the deposition of callose at the neck region},

These advances will facilitate the screening of germplasm with high performance characteristics in resource-limited environments. Recently, plant phenomics has offered and integrated a suite of new technologies, and we are on a path to improve the description of complex plant phenotypes. High-throughput phenotyping platforms have also been developed that capture phenotype data from plants in a non-destructive manner. In this review, we discuss recent developments of high-throughput plant phenotyping infrastructure including imaging techniques and corresponding principles for phenotype data analysis.},

  abstract = {Plants use different immune pathways to combat pathogens. The activation of the jasmonic acid (JA)-signaling pathway is required for resistance against necrotrophic pathogens; however, to combat biotrophic pathogens, the plants activate mainly the salicylic acid (SA)-signaling pathway. SA can antagonize JA signaling and vice versa. NPR1 (noninducible pathogenesis-related 1) is considered a master regulator of SA signaling. NPR1 interacts with TGA transcription factors, ultimately leading to the activation of SA-dependent responses. SA has been shown to promote disease development caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea through NPR1, by suppressing the expression of two JA-dependent defense genes, proteinase inhibitors I and II. We show here that the transcription factor TGA1.a contributes to disease development caused by B. cinerea in tomato by suppressing the expression of proteinase inhibitors I and II. Finally, we present evidence that the SA-signaling pathway contributes to disease development caused by another necrotrophic pathogen, Alternaria solani, in tomato. Disease development promoted by SA through NPR1 requires the TGA1.a transcription factor. These data highlight how necrotrophs manipulate the SAsignaling pathway to promote their disease in tomato.},

Cellular mRNA transcripts, endogenous small RNAs and defense-related small RNAs all move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata (PD), and may even move long distances in the phloem. Despite their small size, PD have complicated substructures, and the area of the pore available for RNA trafficking can be remarkably small. The intent of this review is to bring into focus the role of PD in cell-to-cell and long distance communication in plants. We consider how cellular RNAs could move through the cell to the PD and thence through PD. The protein composition of PD and the possible roles of PD proteins in RNA trafficking are also discussed. Recent evidence for RNA metabolism in organelles acting as a factor in controlling PD flux is also presented, highlighting new aspects of plant intra- and intercellular communication. It is clear that while the phenomenon of RNA mobility is common and essential, many questions remain, and these have been highlighted throughout this review.},

  abstract = {Fruit have evolved a sophisticated tissue and cellular architecture to secure plant reproductive success. Postfertilization growth is perhaps the most dramatic event during fruit morphogenesis. Several studies have proposed that fertilized ovules and developing seeds initiate signaling cascades to coordinate and promote the growth of the accompanying fruit tissues. This dynamic process allows the fruit to conspicuously increase its size and acquire its final shape and means for seed dispersal. All these features are key for plant survival and crop yield. Despite its importance, we lack a high-resolution spatiotemporal map of how postfertilization fruit growth proceeds at the cellular level. In this study, we have combined live imaging, mutant backgrounds in which fertilization can be controlled, and computational modeling to monitor and predict postfertilization fruit growth in Arabidopsis. We have uncovered that, unlike leaves, sepals, or roots, fruit do not exhibit a spatial separation of cell division and expansion domains; instead, there is a separation into temporal stages with fertilization as the trigger for transitioning to cell expansion, which drives postfertilization fruit growth. We quantified the coordination between fertilization and fruit growth by imaging no transmitting tract (ntt) mutants, in which fertilization fails in the bottom half of the fruit. By combining our experimental data with computational modeling, we delineated the mobility properties of the seed-derived signaling cascades promoting growth in the fruit. Our study provides the basis for generating a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing fruit growth and shape.},

Mathematical models are critical for predicting successful vaccine conditions or designing potent antibodies. Existing models are limited by their abstract and poorly structural representations of antigen epitopes. Here, we propose a structural lattice-based model for antibody-antigen affinity. An efficient algorithm is given that predicts the best binding structure of an antibody's amino acid sequence around an antigen with shortened computational time. This structural representation contains key physiological properties, such as affinity jumps and cross-reactivity, and successfully reflects the topology of antigen epitopes, such as pockets and shielded residues. A documented C++ package, Ymir, is provided, suitable for large simulations of affinity maturation. We perform in silico immunizations via germinal center simulations and show that our model can explain complex phenomena like recognition of the same epitope by unrelated clones. We show that the use of cocktails of similar epitopes promotes the development of cross-reactive antibodies. This model opens a new avenue for optimizing multivalent vaccines with combined antigen cocktails or sequential immunizations, and to reveal reasons for vaccine success or failure on a structural basis.},

Near-infrared spectroscopy is the state-of-the-art solution for this analytical demand, but it also has some limitations. Here, we present a novel, rapid, accurate procedure based on time domain-nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR), designed to simultaneously quantify a number of basic seed traits without any seed destruction. Using a low-field, benchtop (1) H-NMR instrument, the procedure gives a high-accuracy measurement of oil content (R(2) = 0.98), carbohydrate content (R(2) = 0.99), water content (R(2) = 0.98) and both fresh and dry weight of seeds/grains (R(2) = 0.99). The method requires a minimum of\~{ }20 mg biomass per sample and thus enables to screen individual, intact seeds. When combined with an automated sample delivery system, a throughput of\~{ }1400 samples per day is achievable. The procedure has been trialled as a proof of concept on cereal grains (collection of\~{ }3000 accessions of Avena spp. curated at the IPK genebank). A mathematical multitrait selection approach has been designed to simplify the selection of outlying (most contrasting) accessions. To provide deeper insights into storage oil topology, some oat accessions were further analysed by three-dimensional seed modelling and lipid imaging. We conclude that the novel TD-NMR-based screening tool opens perspectives for breeding and plant biology in general.},

  abstract = {1. Plants possess numerous mechanisms to control infections by deleterious organisms. Unspecific resistance mechanisms may, however, also exert ecological costs when they have a negative effect on beneficial plant\textendash{}microbe interactions. Such negative effects may even cross the border between a plant's aerial parts and its roots and then affect very central functions such as nutrient uptake and root resistance to micro-organisms. Whereas an impaired nodulation indeed appears common after resistance expression in the leaves, contradictory results have been published for the case of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. 2. We analysed the effect of induction of resistance mechanisms in foliar tissues on AM colonization in soybean plants, using acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) as chemical elicitor. By determining different physiological and biochemical parameters, we assessed whether the effects are related to the activation of the plant defence mechanisms or rather to the re-allocation of primary metabolites. 3. Colonization with AM fungi transiently decreased after pathogen resistance mechanisms were elicited in the aerial parts of the plant. The induction with ASM led to a significant, yet moderate, defence response in the roots, which was modulated in mycorrhizal plants. No allocation or fitness costs associated with the induction of resistance were detected in this study. 4. Synthesis. Our study confirms a transient negative impact of the elicitation of foliar defences on root\textendash{}AM interactions. The results show that induced resistance to foliar pathogens can (i) move from the above-ground to the below-ground compartment and (ii) affect mutualistic micro-organisms as well as plant pathogens. We also conclude that (iii) the negative effect is likely linked to changes in the defence status of the plant rather than to changes in resource allocation patterns and (iv) the AM association can modulate the activation of the plant defence mechanisms and overcome such effects.},

Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, optical projection tomography or X-ray absorption tomography have been used with various success, depending on the size and physical properties of the biological material. RESULTS X-ray in-line phase tomography was applied for the imaging of internal structures of maize seeds at early stages of development, when the cells are metabolically fully active and water is the main cell content. This 3D imaging technique with histology-like spatial resolution is demonstrated to reveal the anatomy of seed compartments with unequalled contrast by comparison with X-ray absorption tomography. An associated image processing pipeline allowed to quantitatively segment in 3D the four compartments of the seed (embryo, endosperm, nucellus and pericarp) from 7 to 21 days after pollination. CONCLUSION This work constitutes an innovative quantitative use of X-ray in-line phase tomography as a non-destructive fast method to perform virtual histology and extends the developmental stages accessible by this technique which had previously been applied in seed biology to more mature samples.},

  abstract = {Plasmodesmata permit solutes to move between cells nonspecifically and without having to cross a membrane. This symplastic connectivity, while straightforward to observe using fluorescent tracers, has proven difficult to quantify. We use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, combined with a mathematical model of symplastic diffusion, to assay plasmodesmata-mediated permeability in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root meristem in wild-type and transgenic lines, and under selected chemical treatments. The permeability measured for the wild type is nearly 10-times greater than previously reported. Plamodesmal permeability remains constant in seedlings treated with auxin (30 mM indoleacetic acid for 2 and 24 h; 100 nm indoleacetic acid for 2 h); however, permeability is diminished in two lines previously reported to have impaired plasmodesmal function as well as in wild-type seedlings treated for 24 h with 0.6 mM tryptophan. Moreover, plasmodesmal permeability is strongly altered by applied hydrogen peroxide within 2 h of treatment, being approximately doubled at a low concentration (0.6 mM) and nearly eliminated at a higher one (6 mM). These results reveal that the plasmodesmata in the root meristem carry a substantial flux of small molecules and that this flux is subject to rapid regulation.},

Plasmodesmata are highly versatile channels; they vary in number and structure, and undergo constant adjustments to their permeability in response to many internal and external cues.

An RNA-seq experiment with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for experimental design. With three biological replicates, nine of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%\textendash{}40\% of the significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to {$>$}85\% for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more than fourfold. To achieve {$>$}85\% for all SDE genes regardless of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates. The same nine tools successfully control their false discovery rate at {$\lessequivlnt$}5\% for all numbers of replicates, while the remaining two tools fail to control their FDR adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that at least six biological replicates should be used, rising to at least 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all fold changes. If fewer than 12 replicates are used, a superior combination of true positive and false positive performances makes edgeR and DESeq2 the leading tools. For higher replicate numbers, minimizing false positives is more important and DESeq marginally outperforms the other tools.},

Here, we obtain this explicit dependence for a model of a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. We call the calculation of the mean escape time the narrow escape problem. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem. Here, we present asymptotic formulas for the mean escape time in several cases, including regular domains in two and three dimensions and in some singular domains in two dimensions. The mean escape time comes up in many applications, because it represents the mean time it takes for a molecule to hit a target binding site. We present several applications in cellular biology: calcium decay in dendritic spines, a Markov model of multicomponent chemical reactions in microdomains, dynamics of receptor diffusion on the surface of neurons, and vesicle trafficking inside a cell.},

Sirius, a process-based model for wheat, was used to estimate yield potential for wheat ideotypes optimized for future climatic projections for ten wheat growing areas of Europe. It was predicted that the detrimental effect of drought stress on yield would be decreased due to enhanced tailoring of phenology to future weather patterns, and due to genetic improvements in the response of photosynthesis and green leaf duration to water shortage. Yield advances could be made through extending maturation and thereby improve resource capture and partitioning. However the model predicted an increase in frequency of heat stress at meiosis and anthesis. Controlled environment experiments quantify the effects of heat and drought at booting and flowering on grain numbers and potential grain size. A current adaptation of wheat to areas of Europe with hotter and drier summers is a quicker maturation which helps to escape from excessive stress, but results in lower yields. To increase yield potential and to respond to climate change, increased tolerance to heat and drought stress should remain priorities for the genetic improvement of wheat. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

In the past two years, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of salicylic-acid biosynthesis and signaling in plants. A pathway similar to that found in some bacteria synthesizes salicylic acid from chorismate via isochorismate. Salicylic-acid signaling is mediated by at least two mechanisms, one requiring the NON-EXPRESSOR OF PR1 (NPR1) gene and a second that is independent of NPR1. Feedback loops involving salicylic acid modulate upstream signals. These feedback loops may provide a point for integrating developmental, environmental and other defense-associated signals, and thus fine-tune the defense responses of plants.},

  abstract = {Wheat is fundamental to human civilization and has played an outstanding role in feeding a hungry world and improving global food security. The crop contributes about 20 \% of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 \% annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 \% of the total harvested area and 50 \% of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 \% of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR ``spared'' essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.},

  abstract = {Liposomal amphotericin B (AMPH-B), also known as AmBisome, exhibits a potent antifungal effect through its binding to ergosterol contained within the fungal cell membrane. However, the mechanism responsible for the movement of AmBisome-derived AMPH-B to the fungal cell membrane through the cell wall is not yet clear. Therefore, in the present study we aimed at elucidating this mechanism operating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. AmBisome showed its antifungal effect against S. cerevisiae at 35\textdegree{}C but not at 4\textdegree{}C, whereas free AMPH-B was effective at both temperatures. A significant difference in the amount of AMPH-B transferred to the fungal cells between incubation at 4 and 35\textdegree{}C was also observed when AmBisome was used. Confocal microscopic study, however, indicated that NBD-labeled AmBisome was localized on the surface of the fungal cells at either temperature. To decrease the affinity of AMPH-B for the liposomal membrane, we entrapped AMPH-B in fluid liposomes containing egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EPC) instead of hydrogenated soy PC (HSPC). These liposomes showed the antifungal effect even at 4\textdegree{}C. On the contrary, AMPH-B in liposomes containing ergosterol (Erg-AmB) instead of cholesterol showed a significantly weaker antifungal effect at 35\textdegree{}C with reduced transfer of AMPH-B to the fungal cells. These results suggest that not the binding of AmBisome to target cells but the transfer of AMPH-B from liposomal membrane of AmBisome to the cell membrane is critical for the antifungal activity of AmBisome. This transfer is dependent on the temperature, fluidity of the liposomal membrane, and the affinity of AMPH-B for the fungal cell membrane.},

One example is systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides long-lasting and broad-spectrum protection at the whole plant level. The induction of SAR prepares the plant for a more robust response to subsequent infections from related and unrelated pathogens. SAR involves the rapid generation of signals at the primary site of infection, which are transported to the systemic parts of the plant presumably via the phloem. SAR signal generation and perception requires an intact cuticle, a waxy layer covering all aerial parts of the plant. A chemically diverse set of SAR inducers has already been identified, including hormones (salicylic acid, methyl salicylate), primary/secondary metabolites (nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, glycerol-3-phosphate, azelaic acid, pipecolic acid, dihyroabetinal), fatty acid/lipid derivatives (18 carbon unsaturated fatty acids, galactolipids), and proteins (DIR1-Defective in Induced Resistance 1, AZI1-Azelaic acid Induced 1). Some of these are demonstrably mobile and the phloem loading routes for three of these SAR inducers is known. Here we discuss the recent findings related to synthesis, transport, and the relationship between these various SAR inducers.},

Flg22 elicitation also leads to ligand-induced endocytosis and degradation of FLS2 within 1 h. Why plant cells remove this receptor precisely at the time during which its function is required remains mainly unknown. Here, we assessed in planta flg22-signaling competency in the context of ligand-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 and chemical interference known to impede flg22-dependent internalization of FLS2 into endocytic vesicles. Within 1 h after an initial flg22 treatment, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaf tissue was unable to reelicit flg22 signaling in a ligand-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that flg22-induced degradation of endogenous FLS2 may serve to desensitize cells to the same stimulus (homologous desensitization), likely to prevent continuous signal output upon repetitive flg22 stimulation. In addition to impeding ligand-induced FLS2 degradation, pretreatment with the vesicular trafficking inhibitors Wortmannin or Tyrphostin A23 impaired flg22-elicited reactive oxygen species production that was partially independent of BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1. Interestingly, these inhibitors did not affect flg22-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, indicating the ability to utilize vesicular trafficking inhibitors to target different flg22-signaling responses. For Tyrphostin A23, reduced flg22-induced reactive oxygen species could be separated from the defect in FLS2 degradation. At later times (2 h) after the initial flg22 elicitation, recovery of FLS2 protein levels positively correlated with resensitization to flg22, indicating that flg22-induced new synthesis of FLS2 may prepare cells for a new round of monitoring the environment for flg22.},

PDs are plasma membrane-lined channels spanning the cell wall between neighbouring cells, allowing the exchange of molecules by symplastic movement through them. This review focuses on developmental decisions that are coordinated by short- and long-distance communication of cells via PDs. We propose a model combining both apoplastic and symplastic signalling events via secreted ligands and their PD-localized receptor kinases which gate the symplastic transport of information molecules through PDs. Cell communities can thus coordinate cell-fate decisions non-cell autonomously by connecting or disconnecting symplastic subdomains. Here we concentrate on the establishment of such subdomains in the plant's primary meristems that serve to maintain long-lasting stem cell populations in the shoot and root apical meristems, and discuss how apoplastic signalling via transport of information molecules through PDs is integrated with symplastic feedback signalling events.},

Pressing questions include how certain cave-related traits are gained and lost, and if they originate through the same or different genetic programs in independent lineages. An excellent system for exploring these questions is the isopod, Asellus aquaticus. This species includes multiple cave and surface populations that have numerous morphological differences between them. A key feature is that hybrids between cave and surface individuals are viable, which enables genetic crosses and linkage analyses. Here, we advance this system by analyzing single animal transcriptomes of Asellus aquaticus. We use high throughput sequencing of non-normalized cDNA derived from the head of a surface-dwelling male, the head of a cave-dwelling male, the head of a hybrid male (produced by crossing a surface individual with a cave individual), and a pooled sample of surface embryos and hatchlings. Assembling reads from surface and cave head RNA pools yielded an integrated transcriptome comprised of 23,984 contigs. Using this integrated assembly as a reference transcriptome, we aligned reads from surface-, cave- and hybrid- head tissue and pooled surface embryos and hatchlings. Our approach identified 742 SNPs and placed four new candidate genes to an existing linkage map for A. aquaticus. In addition, we examined SNPs for allele-specific expression differences in the hybrid individual. All of these resources will facilitate identification of genes and associated changes responsible for cave adaptation in A. aquaticus and, in concert with analyses of other species, will inform our understanding of the evolutionary processes accompanying adaptation to the subterranean environment.},

However, beneficial rhizobacteria, such as Pseudomonas simiae WCS417, promote plant growth and induce systemic resistance without being warded off by local root immune responses. To investigate early root responses that facilitate WCS417 to exert its plant-beneficial functions, we performed time series RNA-Seq of Arabidopsis roots in response to live WCS417 and compared it with MAMPs flg22417 (from WCS417), flg22Pa (from pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal chitin. The MAMP transcriptional responses differed in timing, but displayed a large overlap in gene identity. MAMP-upregulated genes are enriched for genes with functions in immunity, while downregulated genes are enriched for genes related to growth and development. Although 74\% of the transcriptional changes inflicted by live WCS417 overlapped with the flg22417 profile, WCS417 actively suppressed more than half of the MAMP-triggered transcriptional responses, possibly to allow the establishment of a mutually beneficial interaction with the host root. Interestingly, the sector of the flg22417-repressed transcriptional network that is not affected by WCS417 has a strong auxin signature. Using auxin response mutant tir1afb2afb3, we demonstrate a dual role for auxin signaling in finely balancing growth-promoting and defense-eliciting activities of beneficial microbes in plant roots.},

Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin\textendash{}proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize brown midrib mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to U. maydis infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses./p},

However, non-cell-autonomy of small RNA molecules raises the question: To what extent are protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) exchanged between tissues in plants? Here we report the comprehensive identification of 2,006 genes producing mobile RNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The analysis of variant ecotype transcripts that were present in heterografted plants allowed the identification of mRNAs moving between various organs under normal or nutrient-limiting conditions. Most of these mobile transcripts seem to follow the phloem-dependent allocation pathway transporting sugars from photosynthetic tissues to roots via the vasculature. Notably, a high number of transcripts also move in the opposite, root-to-shoot direction and are transported to specific tissues including flowers. Proteomic data on grafted plants indicate the presence of proteins from mobile RNAs, allowing the possibility that they may be translated at their destination site. The mobility of a high number of mRNAs suggests that a postulated tissue-specific gene expression profile might not be predictive for the actual plant body part in which a transcript exerts its function.},

  abstract = {Typically, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are considered to be conserved throughout classes of microbes and to contribute to general microbial fitness, whereas effectors are species, race, or strain specific and contribute to pathogen virulence. Both types of molecule can trigger plant immunity, designated PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered immunity (PTI and ETI, respectively). However, not all microbial defense activators conform to the common distinction between PAMPs and effectors. For example, some effectors display wide distribution, while some PAMPs are rather narrowly conserved or contribute to pathogen virulence. As effectors may elicit defense responses and PAMPs may be required for virulence, single components cannot exclusively be referred to by one of the two terms. Therefore, we put forward that the distinction between PAMPs and effectors, between PAMP receptors and resistance proteins, and, therefore, also between PTI and ETI, cannot strictly be maintained. Rather, as illustrated by examples provided here, there is a continuum between PTI and ETI. We argue that plant resistance is determined by immune receptors that recognize appropriate ligands to activate defense, the amplitude of which is likely determined by the level required for effective immunity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We sought to explore the interactions between roots and soil without disturbance and in four dimensions (i.e. 3-D plus time) using X-ray micro-computed tomography. METHODS: The roots of tomato Solanum lycopersicum 'Ailsa Craig' plants were visualized in undisturbed soil columns for 10 consecutive days to measure the effect of soil compaction on selected root traits including elongation rate. Treatments included bulk density (1.2 vs. 1.6 g cm(-3)) and soil type (loamy sand vs. clay loam). KEY RESULTS: Plants grown at the higher soil bulk density exploited smaller soil volumes (P  0.05) and exhibited reductions in root surface area (P  0.001), total root volume (P  0.001) and total root length (P  0.05), but had a greater mean root diameter (P  0.05) than at low soil bulk density. Swelling of the root tip area was observed in compacted soil (P  0.05) and the tortuosity of the root path was also greater (P  0.01). Root elongation rates varied greatly during the 10-d observation period (P  0.001), increasing to a maximum at day 2 before decreasing to a minimum at day 4. The emergence of lateral roots occurred later in plants grown in compacted soil (P  0.01). Novel rooting characteristics (convex hull volume, centroid and maximum width), measured by image analysis, were successfully employed to discriminate treatment effects. The root systems of plants grown in compacted soil had smaller convex hull volumes (P  0.05), a higher centre of mass (P  0.05) and a smaller maximum width than roots grown in uncompacted soil. CONCLUSIONS: Soil compaction adversely affects root system architecture, influencing resource capture by limiting the volume of soil explored. Lateral roots formed later in plants grown in compacted soil and total root length and surface area were reduced. Root diameter was increased and swelling of the root tip occurred in compacted soil.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate floral staging is required to aid research into pollen and flower development, in particular male development. Pollen development is highly sensitive to stress and is critical for crop yields. Research into male development under environmental change is important to help target increased yields. This is hindered in monocots as the flower develops internally in the pseudostem. Floral staging studies therefore typically rely on destructive analysis, such as removal from the plant, fixation, staining and sectioning. This time-consuming analysis therefore prevents follow up studies and analysis past the point of the floral staging. RESULTS This study focuses on using X-ray \textmu{}CT scanning to allow quick and detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information to allow accurate staging of Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flowers. X-ray \textmu{}CT has previously relied on fixation methods for above ground tissue, therefore two contrast agents (Lugol's iodine and Bismuth) were observed in Arabidopsis and Barley in planta to circumvent this step. 3D models and 2D slices were generated from the X-ray \textmu{}CT images providing insightful information normally only available through destructive time-consuming processes such as sectioning and microscopy. Barley growth and development was also monitored over three weeks by X-ray \textmu{}CT to observe flower development in situ. By measuring spike size in the developing tillers accurate non-destructive staging at the flower and anther stages could be performed; this staging was confirmed using traditional destructive microscopic analysis. CONCLUSION The use of X-ray micro computed tomography (\textmu{}CT) scanning of living plant tissue offers immense benefits for plant phenotyping, for successive developmental measurements and for accurate developmental timing for scientific measurements. Nevertheless, X-ray \textmu{}CT remains underused in plant sciences, especially in above-ground organs, despite its unique potential in delivering detailed non-destructive internal 3D phenotypic information. This work represents a novel application of X-ray \textmu{}CT that could enhance research undertaken in monocot species to enable effective non-destructive staging and developmental analysis for molecular genetic studies and to determine effects of stresses at particular growth stages.},

The tip cell of a staminal hair was microinjected with carboxyfluorescein (CF) and the symplastic transport of this CF was videotaped and the digital data analyzed to produce kinetic curves. Using a finite difference equation for diffusion between cells and for loss of dye into the vacuole, kinetic curves were calculated and fitted to the observed data. These curves were matched with data from actual microinjection experiments by adjusting K (the coefficient of intercellular junction diffusion) and L (the coefficient of intracellular loss) until a minimum in the least squares difference between the curves was obtained. (a) Symplastic transport of CF was governed by diffusion through intercellular pores (plasmodesmata) and intracellular loss. Diffusion within the cell cytoplasm was never limiting. (b) Each cell and its plasmodesmata must be considered as its own diffusion system. Therefore, a diffusion coefficient cannot be calculated for an entire chain of cells. (c) The movement through plasmodesmata in either direction was the same since the data are fit by a diffusion equation. (d) Diffusion through the intercellular pores was estimated to be slower than diffusion through similar pores filled with water.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

However, little is known about the role of PD-mediated signaling during plant morphogenesis. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis gene, CALS3/GSL12. Gain-of-function mutations in CALS3 result in increased accumulation of callose ({$\beta$}-1,3-glucan) at the PD, a decrease in PD aperture, defects in root development, and reduced intercellular trafficking. Enhancement of CALS3 expression during phloem development suppressed loss-of-function mutations in the phloem abundant callose synthase, CALS7 indicating that CALS3 is a bona fide callose synthase. CALS3 alleles allowed us to spatially and temporally control the PD aperture between plant tissues. Using this tool, we are able to show that movement of the transcription factor SHORT-ROOT and microRNA165 between the stele and the endodermis is PD dependent. Taken together, we conclude that regulated callose biosynthesis at PD is essential for cell signaling. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we show that Oenothera drummondii flowers, exposed to the playback sound of a flying bee or to synthetic sound-signals at similar frequencies, produced sweeter nectar within 3 minutes, potentially increasing the chances of cross pollination. We found that the flowers vibrated mechanically in response to these sounds, suggesting a plausible mechanism where the flower serves as the plant's auditory sensory organ. Both the vibration and the nectar response were frequency-specific: the flowers responded to pollinator sounds, but not to higher frequency sound. Our results document for the first time that plants can rapidly respond to pollinator sounds in an ecologically relevant way. Sensitivity of plants to pollinator sound can affect plant-pollinator interactions in a wide range of ways: Plants could allocate their resources more adequately, focusing on the time of pollinator activity; pollinators would then be better rewarded per time unit; flower shape may be selected for its effect on hearing ability, and not only on signaling; and pollinators may evolve to make sounds that the flowers can hear. Finally, our results suggest that plants may be affected by other sounds as well, including antropogenic ones.},

A major phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an essential part in acting towards varied range of stresses like heavy metal stress, drought, thermal or heat stress, high level of salinity, low temperature and radiation stresses. It also finds its role in various developmental processes including seed germination, seed dormancy, and closure of stomata. Abscisic acid acts by modifying the expression level of gene and subsequent analysis of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements of responsive promoters. It also interacts with the signaling molecules of processes involved in retorting to stresses and development of seeds. On the whole, the stress to a plant can be susceptible or tolerant by taking into account the coordinated activities of various stress-responsive genes. Numbers of transcription factor are involved in regulating the expression of abscisic acid responsive genes by acting together with their respective cis-acting elements. Hence, for improvement in stress-tolerance capacity of plants, it is necessary to understand the mechanism behind it. On this ground, this article enlightens the importance and role of ABA signaling with regard to various stresses as well as regulation of abscisic acid biosynthetic pathway along with the transcription factors for stress tolerance.},

The exploratory analysis of such data typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis (PCA) or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit prior knowledge about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an unsupervised method that combines PCA with nonparametric GO enrichment analysis, in order to systematically search for sets of genes that are both strongly correlated and closely functionally related. These gene sets are then used to automatically generate expression signatures with functional labels, which collectively aim to provide a readily interpretable representation of biologically relevant similarities and differences. The robustness of the results obtained can be assessed by bootstrapping. Results I first applied GO-PCA to datasets containing diverse hematopoietic cell types from human and mouse, respectively. In both cases, GO-PCA generated a small number of signatures that represented the majority of lineages present, and whose labels reflected their respective biological characteristics. I then applied GO-PCA to human glioblastoma (GBM) data, and recovered signatures associated with four out of five previously defined GBM subtypes. My results demonstrate that GO-PCA is a powerful and versatile exploratory method that reduces an expression matrix containing thousands of genes to a much smaller set of interpretable signatures. In this way, GO-PCA aims to facilitate hypothesis generation, design of further analyses, and functional comparisons across datasets.},

Although not much is known about this, it is evident that well-coordinated cell-cell signaling is critical in this process to confine infection to local tissue while allowing for the spread of systemic immune signals throughout the whole plant. In support of this notion, direct cell-to-cell communication was recently found to play a crucial role in plant defense. Here, we provide experimental evidence that salicylic acid (SA) is a critical hormonal signal that regulates cell-to-cell permeability during innate immune responses elicited by virulent bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that direct exogenous application of SA or bacterial infection suppresses cell-cell coupling and that SA pathway mutants are impaired in this response. The SA- or infection-induced suppression of cell-cell coupling requires an enhanced desease resistance1- and nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes1-dependent SA pathway in conjunction with the regulator of plasmodesmal gating Plasmodesmata-located protein5. We discuss a model wherein the SA signaling pathway and plasmodesmata-mediated cell-to-cell communication converge under an intricate regulatory loop.},

Traditionally, floral shape variations are quantified using the qualitative and linear measurements of two-dimensional (2D) images. The 2D images cannot adequately describe flower structures, and thus lead to unsatisfactory discrimination of the flower shape. This study aimed to acquire three-dimensional (3D) images by using microcomputed tomography ({$\mu$}CT) and to examine the floral shape variations by using geometric morphometrics (GM). To demonstrate the advantages of the 3D-{$\mu$}CT-GM approach, we applied the approach to a second-generation population of florist's gloxinia (Sinningia speciosa) crossed from parents of zygomorphic and actinomorphic flowers. The flowers in the population considerably vary in size and shape, thereby served as good materials to test the applicability of the proposed phenotyping approach. Procedures were developed to acquire 3D volumetric flower images using a {$\mu$}CT scanner, to segment the flower regions from the background, and to select homologous characteristic points (i.e., landmarks) from the flower images for the subsequent GM analysis. The procedures identified 95 landmarks for each flower and thus improved the capability of describing and illustrating the flower shapes, compared with typically lower number of landmarks in 2D analyses. The GM analysis demonstrated that flower opening and dorsoventral symmetry were the principal shape variations of the flowers. The degrees of flower opening and corolla asymmetry were then subsequently quantified directly from the 3D flower images. The 3D-{$\mu$}CT-GM approach revealed shape variations that could not be identified using typical 2D approaches and accurately quantified the flower traits that presented a challenge in 2D images. The approach opens new avenues to investigate floral shape variations.},

  abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory through various morphological, biochemicals, and molecular mechanisms to counter/offset the effects of herbivore attack. The biochemical mechanisms of defense against the herbivores are wide-ranging, highly dynamic, and are mediated both by direct and indirect defenses. The defensive compounds are either produced constitutively or in response to plant damage, and affect feeding, growth, and survival of herbivores. In addition, plants also release volatile organic compounds that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. These strategies either act independently or in conjunction with each other. However, our understanding of these defensive mechanisms is still limited. Induced resistance could be exploited as an important tool for the pest management to minimize the amounts of insecticides used for pest control. Host plant resistance to insects, particularly, induced resistance, can also be manipulated with the use of chemical elicitors of secondary metabolites, which confer resistance to insects. By understanding the mechanisms of induced resistance, we can predict the herbivores that are likely to be affected by induced responses. The elicitors of induced responses can be sprayed on crop plants to build up the natural defense system against damage caused by herbivores. The induced responses can also be engineered genetically, so that the defensive compounds are constitutively produced in plants against are challenged by the herbivory. Induced resistance can be exploited for developing crop cultivars, which readily produce the inducible response upon mild infestation, and can act as one of components of integrated pest management for sustainable crop production.},

The presented study proposes a strategy to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour of RNA single strands on the basis of the polymer size. By atom-level shell-modelling of high-resolution structures, hydrodynamic radius and diffusion coefficient of evolutionary conserved RNA single strands (ssRNA) were calculated. The diffusion coefficients D of 17\textendash{}174 nucleotides (nt) containing ssRNA depended on the number of nucleotides N with D = 4.56 {\^A} 10{\`A}10 N{\`A}0.39 m2 s{\`A}1.

An average ratio of the radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius of 0.98 {$\pm$} 0.08 was calculated in solution. The empirical law was tested by in solution measured hydrodynamic radii and radii of gyration and was found to be highly consistent with experimental data of evolutionary conserved ssRNA. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic behaviour of several evolutionary unevolved ribonucleic acids could be predicted. Based on atom-level shell-modelling of high-resolution structures and experimental hydrodynamic data, empirical models are proposed, which enable to predict the translational diffusion coefficient and molecular size of short RNA single strands solely on the basis of the polymer size.},

The data provided an opportunity to evaluate the use of measurements as a method to identify morphological domestication from early farming sites. Results were compared to domesticated specimens from a site dating to the end of the seventh millennium situated in the same geographical area and it was found that the upper size range from the Neolithic levels corresponded well with domesticated grains. Data from some published sites was also plotted.

Many individual components and pathways operating during plant defense have been identified, but our knowledge of how these different components interact is still rudimentary. We generated a high-resolution time series of gene expression profiles from a single Arabidopsis thaliana leaf during infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Approximately one-third of the Arabidopsis genome is differentially expressed during the first 48 h after infection, with the majority of changes in gene expression occurring before significant lesion development. We used computational tools to obtain a detailed chronology of the defense response against B. cinerea, highlighting the times at which signaling and metabolic processes change, and identify transcription factor families operating at different times after infection. Motif enrichment and network inference predicted regulatory interactions, and testing of one such prediction identified a role for TGA3 in defense against necrotrophic pathogens. These data provide an unprecedented level of detail about transcriptional changes during a defense response and are suited to systems biology analyses to generate predictive models of the gene regulatory networks mediating the Arabidopsis response to B. cinerea.},

  abstract = {Individual grain weight is a major yield component in wheat. To provide a comprehensive understanding of grain weight determination, the carpel size at anthesis, grain dry matter accumulation, grain water uptake and loss, grain morphological expansion, and final grain weight at different positions within spikelets were investigated in a recombinant inbred line mapping population of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\texttimes{}spelt (Triticum spelta L.). Carpel size, grain dry matter and water accumulation, and grain dimensions interacted strongly with each other. Furthermore, larger carpels, a faster grain filling rate, earlier and longer grain filling, more grain water, faster grain water absorption and loss rates, and larger grain dimensions were associated with higher grain weight. Frequent quantitative trait locus (QTL) coincidences between these traits were observed, particularly those on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4A, 5A, 5DL, and 7B, each of which harboured 16-49 QTLs associated with 12 traits. Analysis of the allelic effects of coincident QTLs confirmed their physiological relationships, indicating that the complex but orderly grain filling processes result mainly from pleiotropy or the tight linkages of functionally related genes. After grain filling, distal grains within spikelets were smaller than basal grains, primarily due to later grain filling and a slower initial grain filling rate, followed by synchronous maturation among different grains. Distal grain weight was improved by increased assimilate availability from anthesis. These findings provide deeper insight into grain weight determination in wheat, and the high level of QTL coincidences allows simultaneous improvement of multiple grain filling traits in breeding.},

  abstract = {In plants, plasmodesmata (PD) serve as channels for micromolecular and macromolecular cell-to-cell transport. Based on structure, PD in immature tissues are classified into two types, simple and branched (X- and Y-shaped) or twinned. The maximum size of molecules capable of PD transport defines PD aperture, known as the PD size exclusion limit. Here we report an Arabidopsis mutation, decreased size exclusion limit1 (dse1), that exhibits reduced cell-to-cell transport of the small (524 Da) fluorescent tracer 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid at the midtorpedo stage of embryogenesis. Correspondingly, the fraction of X- and Y-shaped and twinned PD was reduced in dse1 embryos compared with WT embryos at this stage, suggesting that the frequency of PD is related to transport capability. dse1 is caused by a point mutation in At4g29860 (previously termed TANMEI) at the last donor splice site of its transcript, resulting in alternative splicing in both the first intron and the last intron. AtDSE1 is a conserved eukaryotic 386-aa WD-repeat protein critical for Arabidopsis morphogenesis and reproduction. Similar to its homologs in mouse, null mutants are embryo-lethal. The weak loss-of-function mutant dse1 exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including retarded vegetative growth, delayed flowering time, dysfunctional male and female organs, and delayed senescence. Finally, silencing of DSE1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves leads to reduced movement of GFP fused to tobacco mosaic virus movement protein. Thus, DSE1 is important for regulating PD transport between plant cells.},

One response is the closure of plasmodesmata, which reduces symplastic connectivity and the capacity for direct molecular exchange between host cells. Plasmodesmal flux is regulated by a variety of environmental cues but the downstream signalling pathways are poorly defined, especially the way in which calcium regulates plasmodesmal closure. Here, we identify that closure of plasmodesmata in response to bacterial flagellin, but not fungal chitin, is mediated by a plasmodesmal-localized Ca2+-binding protein Calmodulin-like 41 (CML41). CML41 is transcriptionally upregulated by flg22 and facilitates rapid callose deposition at plasmodesmata following flg22 treatment. CML41 acts independently of other defence responses triggered by flg22 perception and reduces bacterial infection. We propose that CML41 enables Ca2+-signalling specificity during bacterial pathogen attack and is required for a complete defence response against Pseudomonas syringae.},

The deposition and degradation of callose at the neck region of plasmodesmata (Pd) is one of the cellular control mechanisms regulating Pd permeability during both abiotic and biotic stresses. Callose accumulation at Pd is controlled by callose synthases (CalS; EC 2.4.1.34), endogenous enzymes mediating callose synthesis, and by {$\beta$}-1,3-glucanases (BG; EC 3.2.1.39), hydrolytic enzymes which specifically degrade callose. Transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of some CalSs and BGs are strongly controlled by stress signaling, such as that resulting from pathogen invasion. We review the role of Pd-associated callose in the regulation of intercellular communication during developmental, physiological, and stress response processes. Special emphasis is placed on the involvement of Pd-callose in viral pathogenicity. Callose accumulation at Pd restricts virus movement in both compatible and incompatible interactions, while its degradation promotes pathogen spread. Hence, studies on mechanisms of callose turnover at Pd during viral cell-to-cell spread are of importance for our understanding of host mechanisms exploited by viruses in order to successfully spread within the infected plant.},

  abstract = {Arabidopsis downy mildew resistant 6 (dmr6) mutants have lost their susceptibility to the downy mildew Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Here we show that dmr6 is also resistant to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete Phytophthora capsici. Resistance is accompanied by enhanced defense gene expression and elevated salicylic acid levels. The suppressive effect of the DMR6 oxygenase was confirmed in transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing DMR6 that show enhanced susceptibility to H. arabidopsidis, P. capsici, and P. syringae. Phylogenetic analysis of the superfamily of 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases revealed a subgroup of DMR6-LIKE OXYGENASEs (DLOs). Within Arabidopsis, DMR6 is most closely related to DLO1 and DLO2. Overexpression of DLO1 and DLO2 in the dmr6 mutant restored the susceptibility to downy mildew indicating that DLOs negatively affect defense, similar to DMR6. DLO1, but not DLO2, is co-expressed with DMR6, showing strong activation during pathogen attack and following salicylic acid treatment. DMR6 and DLO1 differ in their spatial expression pattern in downy mildew-infected Arabidopsis leaves; DMR6 is mostly expressed in cells that are in contact with hyphae and haustoria of H. arabidopsidis, while DLO1 is expressed mainly in the vascular tissues near infection sites. Strikingly, the dmr6-3\_dlo1 double mutant, that is completely resistant to H. arabidopsidis, showed a strong growth reduction that was associated with high levels of salicylic acid. We conclude that DMR6 and DLO1 redundantly suppress plant immunity, but also have distinct activities based on their differential localization of expression.},

  abstract = {For many years, plant pathology was divided into two schools of thought. It was clear that purified molecules or crude extracts from microbes or plants (referred to as general elicitors) could induce acti- vation of general defense responses (Boller, 1995). Geneticists instead were studying plant resistance triggered by the recognition of a given pathogen Avirulence gene product by the corresponding plant Resistance (R) gene product (Dangl and Jones, 2001). This resistance followed the gene-for-gene hypothesis, was often associated with a hypersensitive response, and was widely used in breeding programs. It was however confusing why a pathogen would produce Avirulence products that would cause its recognition and subsequent host resistance.},

  abstract = {Plants are constantly exposed to would-be pathogens in their immediate environment. Yet, despite relying on innate immunity only, plants are resistant to most microbes. They employ pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) for sensitive and rapid detection of the potential danger caused by microbes and pests. Plant PRRs are either surface-localized receptor kinases (RKs) or receptor-like proteins (RLPs) containing various ligand-binding ectodomains that perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In this review, I summarize our current knowledge of plant PRRs and their ligands, illustrating the multiple molecular strategies employed by plant PRRs to activate innate immune signaling to survive.},
